Same for ryes -- the differences in pricing from Rossville Union, Templeton, NuLu, Nashville Barrel Co., Four Gate, Proof &amp; Wood, etc. are enormous.

I don't want to be an idiot and pay three times as much for the same product. But people really seem to think there are big differences. Is the whole ""they have access to better barrels"" thing really true? Tbc, I'm not really asking about value -- that's too subjective -- I'm more asking whether people think the high-priced NDPs like Four Gate, Nashville Barrel, and NuLu are really putting out a better product than the cheaper ones.

$61, 46%

Color:  very light straw yellow.

Neat, in a very small (3 or 4 oz?) snifter.  Rested 10 minutes.

Nose: immediate overripe fruit funk, floral, peat smoke, sweet, bbq, light ammonia, smelly feet funk (faint), orange, orange peel, durian, banana, mineral water/ crushed shells, sandal wood, grapefruit peel, light oak bitterness, mesquite bean, very enjoyable slightly complex nose. I get something different each time it seems.

Taste: salty, sweet, oak, savory, shells, peat, clean, tobacco smoke (but good), new baseball glove leather, sometimes reminds me of Laphroiag, but cleaner, more like Lagavulin 9 (GOT). (this has 35% Laphroaig). vanilla cream. Ledaig minerality. 

Finish: long lingering peat, like bbq pit ash.

I have a 1981 Gold Medal Amsterdam (among *many, many* others), and the one shop I called offered me 200$ for it, which I wasn't really happy with, so if y'all know anywhere with good buying rates please let me know!",0,2022-04-28 03:33:05

Since I've lived at my new place I've had multiple whiskeys change taste (to unpalatable) after opening. Cheap or expensive, hasn't mattered. I don't leave them open and 90% of the time pour into a glass to drink. Am I buying from a bad store or is there something else going on that I don't know about?  Most recently I bought a bottle of Angels Envy. I have half a bottle left and I just noticed it has some sort of sediment (was not there when I purchased it) and it tastes so off that it's no good to me.

BmoreBlueJay,trqha4,0,whiskey,Advice Deciding What To Collect,"Hi All!  I‚Äôm just now getting into the world of collecting whiskeys/bourbons.  One thing that puzzles me is how do you decide what arena to focus on collecting in, whether Kentucky bourbon, Scotch whiskey, Irish whiskey, Japanese whiskey, etc.  Based on your own experience, how did you decide which type of whiskey to collect?  Or do you focus on the best of all types?  

For reference, my fianc√© is from Kentucky so I‚Äôm a bit biased that direction but not sold on not collecting Irish, Canadian, etc.",12,2022-03-30 06:20:25

ChocCheesecake08,ts7xva,1,whiskey,Looking for a scotch/whiskey similar to Buchanan 18 year.,"I hate scotch / whiskey BUT my fianc√© loves it.  Problem is his favorite was the Buchanan 18 year which is no longer available.

My plan was to send over a bottle of Buchanan 18 year on our wedding day for him and his brothers (groomsmen) as my gift to him, so this has thrown a wrench in my plans. Here‚Äôs what I know.

1. He has tried the other Buchanan products, including masters.  His claim is that they have a burn more intense compared to the 18 year and they‚Äôre not as smooth.  He also does not feel the flavor is as good.

2.  He pairs his scotch/whiskey with cigars.  His go to cigar is Tatiana, though he probably won‚Äôt smoke on the wedding day because I hate the smell of smoke.

3.  He hates Monkey Shoulder.  There was a Japanese one he also hated but I can‚Äôt remember the name of it.

While I know everyone‚Äôs taste is different, I‚Äôm trying to see this an opportunity to get him something new to try, even if he doesn‚Äôt like it. Our wedding is 4/30/22.  So if I get it and he doesn‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs fine.  But I want to get him something new.

Money doesn‚Äôt matter.  From my understanding, a good scotch/whiskey doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to cost a lot but if it did, I‚Äôd still be open to hear a suggestion.  Thank you.",0,2022-03-30 22:40:20

Wild Turkey, Four Roses (small batch), Woodford Reserve, and Elijah Craig (small batch)  


I absolutely loved the Wild Turkey and Four Roses.  If they didn't exactly ""knock my socks off"", I'd say they were at least hanging by my toes.  As to the Woodford Reserve and EC, honestly I could take them or leave them.  So to you experts out there, what do you think I'm enjoying about the first two.  This may sound like a silly question, but I'm asking to help refine my palate.  Thanks.

DrDickFartJohnson,tso7hz,1,whiskey,"Why do people purchase Blanton's whiskey? I've never heard of it, what's its deal? Ripoff?","I came home from work and my sister proudly announced she purchased their standard single cask 750ml for her boyfriend. Her boyfriend mind you who likes the **Idea** of whiskey, but never drinks it. *He even re-gifted a bottle of Macallan 12  a few years ago.* Anyways, she thought it a good idea to buy him a *'fancy'* bottle of whiskey and didn't bother checking with anyone who knows anything about liquor. While I certainly know most my whiskeys I've not heard of Blanton's before and never encountered it while I bartended at a high end club for years which had a large rotation of quality liquor.  She looked at my shocked as I told her it didn't ring a bell... 

She claims she got a deal on it because her coworker had a 'connection' and hooked her up. (lol) She spent over $185 us on it and claims that's a good deal. MSRP says the bottle is $65 so more then double that doesn't seem like a good price. It was bottled only 1 month and half ago so i'm guessing there is no aging process driving up the price...So why is it so damn expensive? Do people just like the tacky bottle? Is it just 'luxury' buffalo trace? No hate here or anything, just genuinely trying to rap my head around the whole thing and got nothing.  I'm no snob when it comes to whiskey, but this just seems ridiculous. 

 So what's the deal with it? Have I been living under a rock?

I‚Äôve been a big fan of bourbon since I moved to Kentucky, and I still really enjoy scotch when I go back to my roots, but for some reason this one and specifically Jameson just hit my pallet as overwhelmingly buttery to the point I can‚Äôt really enjoy it. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs Irish whiskey in general bc I enjoyed red breast so much‚Ä¶ in fact it‚Äôs one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôd describe red breast as super balanced and clean.

Guess I‚Äôll be saving this bottle for when my dad comes to visit, but I‚Äôd like to hear some suggestions for other Irish whiskeys I could try besides red breast so I can expand on the style. Also, having some background in chemistry I‚Äôd be interested if anyone has insight into why I‚Äôm just tasting butter when I drink it.

Nightcap_Whisky,segv7w,1,whiskey,The Glenlivet N'adurra Peated Scotch Whisky Review,"  

Hey Peat fans,

I hope the work week is treating everyone well.

Only one more day to go for the most of us and then it‚Äôs time for some rest and relaxation.

This week I ended up sitting down with The Glenlivet N‚ÄôAdurra ..not the Oloroso Sherry finish but the Peated version. 

Some basic notes below:

¬∑ ABV: 61.5% abv

¬∑ Non chill filtered, no colour added

¬∑ Batch: PW1015

**Nose:** To me this noses as low peat level (talisker as an example ‚Äì 10-13ppm), citrus, apple, sea breeze

**Palate:** maritime saltiness, mushroom / oyster, honey, smoke, apple, pear, citrus, black pepper, mango, toffee, marmalade

**Finish:** Long with that hug you get with a high abv / proof

**Overall:** I‚Äôm a fan of this scotch; however, it‚Äôs not as complex as something like Ardbeg, Port Charlotte, etc. Pricing for this bottle is $70-80 USD/CAD, but there are many other expressions available in the market I would buy first before coming back to this one again. 

If you wanted to follow the video review as well, a link has been placed below.

Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend. 

Cheers üì∑

Vershneim,sezlfq,1,whiskey,Question on MGP and Rye Diversity,"I'm relatively new to whiskey, but one thing I have learned so far is that I like rye. However, I've also learned that a lot of the ""juice"" used in different companies' rye products are sourced from the same company, MGP. My question: how different are these ryes from each other? And where do these differences come from? Is it just different aging / in different barrels?

And the follow-up question: As I'm trying not to spend too much money on whiskey at the moment, I try to have at most three bottles in the house at a time. Are these ryes different enough to warrant having two of my ""slots"" taken up by ryes, or is it smarter to just have one at a time (trying different ones as I finish each bottle), and have a more varied selection to try?

(Obviously, these questions are subjective, but just curious what your thoughts are.)",0,2022-01-29 04:13:55

Your_Moooom_XD,rqcfa7,1,whiskey,Good Tasting Whiskeys,"Hey guys, I recently began to dive into the world of Whiskeys and I've been enjoying it so far. I'm not too experienced, and so, I haven't had many Whiskeys to try out and taste. I've only Jack Daniel's and Buchanan's 12, but as much as I try, they are too harsh and bitter, and I don't enjoy it. I've been trying to get myself a Redbreast 12, but I've been unsuccessful. 

Today though, I have a glass of skrewball, and it tasted very good. I loved the taste of caramel and marshmallow, and how well it blended with the whiskey. I'm sure there are more whiskeys with their own unique, delicious flavors. What bottles would you guys recommend that have a good taste and aren't overshadowed by the flavor of bitter liquor?

Anything under $100 is fine, and any kind of Whiskey is also okay. Thanks!",0,2021-12-28 17:57:33

The shelves I currently have them on look ok (picture below, there is a bottom shelf that cannot be seen, and a bar in front) but I am concerned long term about the weight. Additionally, the shelf height makes grouping more difficult because of some of the taller bottle styles.

I don't have gremlins yet, but locking is certainly a consideration down the road as well.

Hi,

I'll start off by saying I've never actually written on this sub. I kind of gloss through the pictures of other people's posts. But - here is my review of McClelland Islay Singke Malt Scotch Whiskey. 

First off: I'm no connoisseur of Whiskey. So- please don't be too harsh. I didn't purchase the bottle. I was at a weekly event and it was distributed to the members of this club. 

I was hesitant at first. I've had some pretty fire brand Whiskey's before. You know the kind where the minute it's in your mouth -  you know it going to go down burning hot. Like you can get a desel submarine to run for an extra 49 minutes with this stuff kind type of a burn ? I approached drinking this with that kind of caution to say the least. 

Well - we said cheers and I threw it back. And I was so wrong. My first impression was: Hey- this is smooth stuff. Okay... and secondly- wow ! This is woodsy. An image if a wood cask being lite on fire and allowed to burn for a while was what came to mind immediately. An old time taste. An outdoors taste. I was able to taste the aroma if that makes any sense ? Like - sometimes a coffee smells like vanilla, but tastes like coffee ? Well this smelled like an old wooden cask and this tasted like that - but a notch or two up. It tasted "" stronger"" then it smelled - which was a surprise. I guess you call that "" full bodied"". I don't know. 

Swallowing it was also painless and no after affects like the feeling of heart burn or burping. Like super clean. 

I had 2 shots within 5 minutes of each other and that was enough. The Whiskey started to take effect with a nice warm feeling 2 minutes after the last shot. And it was not really an "" intoxicated "" feeling - just a warm, happy feel - which is what I was looking for. 

I did later go to the store and look for a bottle and the clerk gave me some info. He said that this is the lower end brand. That the Whiskey was aged in bw ( I think) 3 - 12 year old casks whatever was available. And that the higher end one - which is under a different brand name is only done in 12 year old casks. I could have that wrong but...ya I bought the older one  for 68 for a special occasion in 2 months ( 3RD kid ). 

All in all - at 47 dollars a bottle - I would highly recommend. Doesn't break the bank, it an awesome conversation starter. üëå 

Hope you enjoyed my review.",3,2021-11-28 13:24:34

masm128,r44cb3,1,whiskey,Is the Arran 10 only bitter for me?,"Hello good people!  
I've bought an Arran 10 because of good reviews that can be found on the internet and great price.  
The neck pour was quite nice, mostly sweet, a bit fruity I guess and there was a bitter note in the end/finish. Now that I've let it rest for a week and tried it again it somehow got less intense in aromas, and now the bitter note got empowered very much! Basically the front and mid is a bit sweet, some small amount of fruit and a little salty, and then on the finish it is just super strong bitterness that overpowers everything, kind of like when you bite on a seed accidently when eating a fruit. This strong bitterness has now become a pretty long finish and an aftertaste that hangs with me for quite a while. Even influences other whisky tastings.  
Do I have a bad bottle? Has anyone experienced something similar with the Arran 10?  
Thanks!",3,2021-11-28 21:29:46

youlleatitandlikeit,r5689g,1,whiskey,Extremely smooth but relatively inexpensive high-proof whiskies to get me habituated to cask strength whiskies?,"I have a few cask strength whiskies that I struggle to enjoy because of their strength. Basically, the proof and alcohol get in the way, it's all I can taste.

Right now my sweet spot is probably 90-100 proof, so for example I can drink WT 101 with no difficulties whatsoever. It's the stronger ones that hit between 115-130 proof that I find challenging.

So I'm hoping there's a decent quality but not very expensive high proof whiskey that I can sharpen my teeth on so to speak, something that is enjoyable to drink but also relatively cheap so I'm not throwing a lot of money at getting good at drinking strong liquor.",30,2021-11-30 05:31:34

3. Glenfarclas 17, 21,  and 25, and potentially have a little left over.

At the bottom it just mentions to contact whoever I get my high west from, which in my case would have to be one of the chains (Dallas-Fort Worth area, not really any mom and pop liquor stores).

Do I really just need to call around and ask to be placed on a wait list for AMNWD, or am I pretty much SOL as a mid-20s guy who has not spent nearly enough money at any liquor store to have pull of some kind?

ExcitablesaurusRex,py34o7,1,whiskey,Birthday Whiskey Collection,"Good afternoon all! This is my first reddit post, and boy did I pick a long one!

So after about 10 years of trying my wife and I finally had our first baby (boy) a couple months ago and I decided about halfway into the pregnancy that I wanted to gift him for his 21^(st) birthday several bottles of whisk(e)y and some Norlan glasses (my wife thinks I'm nuts for all of this). Since I'm a big whisk(e)y fan, I'm hoping to share this passion with my son when he comes of legal age to do so and my thought process is that he'll either love the gift or I'll have a kickass addition to my own extensive collection in 2 decades. I'm posting this list up for opinions and input as I'd like to give him a nice worldwide tour of whisk(e)y. I'm completely open to country of origin and classification: as long as it's whisk(e)y by definition and remotely obtainable, it's fair game for this list; bonus points for oddball non mainstream stuff that I've missed. Since I'll have a good while before he'll receive any of these, I'm pretty open to pricing and I've obviously got some time to save up if the selections end up $$$$.

The list:

1. Blood Oath Pact 7
2. Evan Williams Single Barrel
3. Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
4. Starward Two-Fold
5. St. Augustine Distillery Barrel #194 (more info: [Facebook link](https://www.facebook.com/StAugustineDistilleryCompany/posts/4359999987377701))
6. Old Ezra 7 year
7. Kurayoshi 8 year. I had Iwai Tradition many years ago and loved it, but my experience in Japanese whiskeys is severely lacking, so I'd like some input here
8. Knob Creek 9 year (SB or SiB) or Knob Creek 12 year. I'd like *a* Knob Creek, just unsure which would ring better for a new drinker.
9. Lagavulin 11 Year Old Nick Offerman Guinness Cask Finish
10. Blue Run Rye if it comes around again. I'm not a big rye fan personally, but recognize that my son very well could be, so I'd like some input on a ryes.
11. The Dalmore 15
12. Redbreast 21
13. thru #?. Any further additions to this list that hit any of the major whisk(e) points I may have missed.

I'm skipping the super cheap/easy to get stuff (Jack Daniel's, Makers Mark, etc.) as those can be picked up anywhere, anytime.

Full disclosure: a while back, I did had the zany idea to have as close to 21 unique and consecutive vintages as possible, but that task got out of hand way too fast and is definitely no longer something I'm chasing.

Thanks for checking out my long post and I look forward to the feedback.",19,2021-09-30 03:48:04

normandyblues,pfjflk,1,whiskey,Sampling Whisky at a budget.,"Okay so this might be a stupid question but please bear with me. I've been into cigars for a while now and the great thing about cigars is that to sample, i.e. to learn the taste of, a brand/model, you don't need to buy a whole box of cigars. You can just buy a stick and have an experience of the brand. However in whisky, in my knowledge, you usually have to get full sized 70cc bottles (very expensive). I know some brands produce small bottles and I've had them but most of them don't. For example to be able to taste a good Yamazaki you don't have a small bottle option you need to drop $$$$ even if you want just to get a sip if you know what I mean.

Now - are there any alternatives to this? Any organizations that sell/produce 30ml-50ml samples etc.? Or is there any other way I can sample whisky without having to buy huge bottles which I have no idea if I will finish? What would be your advice to me?

What are your opinions on this issue? Thx.",22,2021-09-01 09:21:33

I'm really trying to be ahead of the 'game' and track down the upcoming Birthday Bourbon release. My small store or even larger store owner/operators tell me ""yeah good luck with that"" or ""I've seen that bottle once in my career of 10 years here"".

So is this whiskey that incredible that it's god's gift to earth? Is it the rarity or the hype train of the whiskey boom we are currently in? I digress.

EmotionalPack7721,pfvryx,1,whiskey,A newbie question about that types to look for,"Under the circumstances I grew up, liquor on the whole is very limited. I only had my first glass after collage. That was a shot of tequila &amp; jager bomb. Other than that I have had mojito (I love it). As for beer, I like Hoegaarden &amp; stella. I do enjoy vodka cocktail with mountain dew or orange. That is my quick background about liquor. So, pardon if I use the wrong terms, I am just learning things.

My first whiskey that I actually enjoyed was Jack Daniels Honey on ice. I even enjoyed JD Fire. Chivas12, San Sinclair 16, Old Monk - these I could not even tolerate the smell. 

I just tried JD gentle man jack, I stirred the glass but still all I can smell in the alcohol and none of the smell of the drink. I even tried adding some drops of water &amp; even on ice. Still could not smell it and when I took a sip, tasteless &amp; I had a burning sensation in my chest. Didn't enjoy it at all. But when I saw the online reviews on youtube, they keep talk about various smells and how smooth it is. I didn't feel anything. What am I missing? (FYI: [How to do a whiskey tasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boj33DVSILQ) video on the FAQ is not working).

Compared to Monkey Shoulders, there was the alcohol but still I could smell something, its tasted alright in my mouth and didn't burn as I was sipping it. But I did enjoy making a [hot toddy](https://youtu.be/bWEaQrNySZ4), I switched out the sugar completely for an extra dash of Angostura Bitters.

So, what is the type of whiskey that will suit my taste? Any tips or suggestions?

I don't have anyone around me to suggest new things and go exploring. So, that is why I am asking here. Just suggest the kind of things to look for, so i can ask for it at my local liquior store.",8,2021-09-01 23:05:54

Guido183,ova84a,1,whiskey,$20-40 starter whiskey,"Hello guys,

Tomorrow I will turn 18 and I would love to celebrate that with a nice bottle. However, picking the best one is hard for me. The only whiskey's I have tasted are the Famous Grouse and Bushmills Original, Black Bush and Red Bush. I particularly liked the Famous Grouse a lot, especially because it was easy on the throat and didn't burn as much as the Bushmills did for me. There are more whiskeys i drank, but those were very cheap and tasted like dogshit. Also, I don't know if this helps with deciding what is best for me, but I love espresso.

Now I have heard great things about Monkey shoulder, but there also seem to be a lot of people that don't like it. Same with Glennfiddich 12 and Glenlivet 12. People contradict each other all the time, especially on reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here are some bottles that I can get my hands on in my country, within my budget:

Monkey Shoulder (0,7L) - $27

Glennfiddich 12 (0,7L) - $30

Laphroaig Select (0,7L) - $32

Highland Park 10 (0,7L) - $36

Glenlivet 12 (0,7L) - $36

Four Roses small batch 2015 (0,7L) - $36

Talisker 10 &amp; Skye - $39

Laphroaig 10 &amp; Quarter Cask - $39

Glennfiddich Malt Masters Edition - $40

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a big problem is that I am not very familiar with smokey whiskeys. Therefore, buying one is a bit risky. I do think I like smokey flavours, but I am afraid it will not be the kind of smokey I have in mind. Personally I am leaning towards the Glennfiddich 12, but the Monkey Shoulder bottle just looks so damn good aswell. I am also very interested in Laphroaig as a whole, but I'm afraid that I won't like it, because people say it tastes very unique.

&amp;#x200B;

WhiskyWriter,ovjt8q,1,whiskey,A humble review: Ichiro's Malt - Ace of Diamonds,"Whiskey people!   
Dear Readers-

First, apologies for my long and silent absence. The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. When last we chitted and chatted, I received quite the virtual tongue lashing for daring to speak, nay *type*, my innermost thoughts on whiskey. The veritable cornucopia of comments, brimming with toxic and slanderous scoldings, would be enough to drive any writer (whisky or otherwise), off the internet for good. So off I limped into the dark corners of the Reddit.com messaging forums, licking my wounds; chagrined from the heapings of scorn of my fellow whiskey enthuses. Back, I am, though! Here to, once again, unleash my raging thoughts upon the whisky world and community! Reinvigorated with whiskey tinged gusto!

Second, *Konnichiwa,* yoi tsuitachi! Whilst breaking from the ‚ÄúWhiskey Network‚Äù I was most certainly not *braking* my whisky journey, nor resting upon my laurels. The world called to me, as doth a mother to her heifer - ‚ÄúCome and see! Live! Experience! Drink! Love! Partake! All this can be yours, and more!‚Äù Now, *never have I ever* been one to ignore the call of wanderlust, I hastily packed a lightweight suitcase, jet-setting off into the sunset,  to see my penultimate lady lover, Gaia, Earth in all her lustrous glory. It should be noted here, that my travel was during 2018 and 2019. All of my notes were jotted down previously, and I have taken the time to hone (Á£®„Åê) my prose. If you have yet to guess, my travels landed me in the Land of the Rising Sun, Dai Nippon! JAPAN!

Admittedly, Dai Nippon tugs at my core being. I am forever entranced by Japanese Culture. Fear not, Dear Reader, I am not some ‚Äúweeaboo‚Äù dedicated to worshipping at the altar of ‚ÄúKawaii;‚Äù chasing some imaginary dragon for ever smallening and cutening memorabilia. Nay, my love and curiosity come from a place of deep respect, or Ikei no nen (ÁïèÊï¨„ÅÆÂøµ). From this place of ikei, I sought to find the rarest and most luscious of the unicorns: the fabled Ichiro‚Äôs Malt - the Deck of Card series! I spent many a night in the streets of Tokyo in samay≈ç for these rare and hidden gems. As luck would have it, I found them at several places, though much, much too È´ò„ÅÑ (expensive!!).  Then, on the eve of my last night, when all hope seemed lost, and I was at my wit‚Äôs end, I found one. The famous Ace of Diamonds, open and at a price that seemed too good to be true! SUGOI!! We shall see if it is true what the great Ralphy has said, which is that while the Scotsman may have invented Scotch, it was the Japanese who perfected it! (Paraphrasing).
_____
(Some will be happy to note, I‚Äôve changed my review methods, as many complained it too verbose.)  


*Drinking with my eyes*:  A viscous melange of gilded lilies, dried orange rind, and autumnal hay.  

*Drinking with my nose*: Sweet molasses, cream, barbecued shrimp, fermented soy sauce, a wet forest after a summer rain (or petricore).  


*Drinking with my tongue*: Sweet Christmas! Oishii!! Creamy buttered potatoes, lilac infused essential oils, poppy seeded muffins, toasted marshmallows, „ÉÅ„Éß„Ç≥„É¨„Éº„Éà, fresh cut grass wet with the morning dew.  

*Final thoughts and musings*: Oh! How my senses they do sing! If Shakespeare was not writing about women, surely he was writing about this malt! So perfect! So subtle! So gentle! „Åì„ÅÆ„Ç¶„Ç§„Çπ„Ç≠„Éº„Çí„ÅÆ„Çì„Åß„Å™„Åå„Çâ„ÄÅÈ†≠„ÅåÈúß„Å´„Å™„Å¶„ÄÅÁ©∫Ê∞ó„ÅåË™≠„ÇÅ„Å™„ÅÑ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™ÊÑü„Åò„Å´„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü  

*The hard facts:* **84/100**. So very good. So very solid. Not as earth shattering as one would believe.

Nothing too fancy, I bought a Jameson, but I absolutely love it. On the first sip, it immediately felt 'creamier' than what I've had in the past, and it was very smooth.

So, now I wonder, is this a trait of Irish whiskeys or is it exclusive to Jameson? I've heard glowing reviews of Redbreast, and that's my next stop. But, I want to know if I can expect that same 'creamy' note from Redbreast, as well. And, if I can't, could you point me in the direction of more whiskeys like Jameson?

PlinyToTrajan,ow5d4i,1,whiskey,What's the deal with blended whiskeys?,"So, I'm totally new the whiskey world and am yet to actually try any whiskey.  (My first post in this forum was a few days ago, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/orpeb2/please_advise_first_glass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).)

My  na√Øve reaction to blended whiskeys is to be turned off.  I was surprised to learn that even expensive, matured whiskeys like the high end of the Johnnie Walker line (even the Blue Label) are blends of several whiskeys.

Here's how the Johnnie Walker website describes the *Gold Label Reserve*:

 *\[A\] wonderful tribute to the harmonious partnership of Speyside and Highland whiskies, with just a hint of smoldering embers from the West Coast.*

Or *Johnnie Walker Blue*:

 *An exquisite combination of Scotland‚Äôs rarest and most exceptional whiskies.*

Why take a rare and exceptional whiskey and fudge up the taste by muddling it with others?  Doesn't this statement make you yearn to taste one of the (perhaps mythical) ""rare and exceptional"" whiskeys that are the precursors of the blend?

There's something about the blending that, for me, goes against the idea of an artisanal agricultural product.  Isn't it possible, through careful selection of the ingredients, use of a barrel to impart flavor, and maturation to achieve great complexity?  And isn't there an art in that, that's lost by blending?

What should I know about blended whiskeys?",22,2021-08-02 10:08:12

Thoughts on what should be next?](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/o2jstf/i_love_me_some_whiskey_so_i_decided_to_start_a/)

Since then, I got to taste them all and while all of them are good, the Bunnahabhain 12 is an absolute killer, I can't get enough of it. I had an idea how Ardbeg will taste and I love it, Balvenie is smooth and fruity and cherried (maybe too smooth and somewhat bland for me) but Bunnahabhain 12 checks all the right boxes - I smell ripe fruits, some wooden notes with hint of smokiness in the background, I taste vanilla, caramel and the slightest hint of smoke...

All in all, while I thought that Ardbeg will be it, it turns out that I love less peaty Islay whiskies. I will be DEFINITELY buying a backup, maybe two - care to recommend another less peaty Islays to add to collection? Thanks!",1,2021-07-01 22:13:04

Whisk(e)y tasting party,"Hosting a whisk(e)y tasting party on Saturday and one thing I genuinely do not know is whether or not to rinse the glass out between tastes. This is mostly for beginners, so I've got a broad range of styles/regions represented, so I want to make sure they get the nuance of each spirit, making me think a rinse is appropriate. But if we rinse, there's bound to be residual water in the glass, and I want them to be able to taste each spirit as it's intended before adding distilled water (if desired). Of course we can dry with a cloth/paper towel, but that might leave little traces behind...I'm probably way overthinking this, but any input is appreciated haha. Thanks all.",20,2021-07-02 00:39:04

-ShaiHulud-,obsb50,1,whiskey,Whiskey and Pretentiousness,"Hello fellow whiskey nerds. I have always enjoyed a lovely dram, but I've never really been a particular nerd about it and haven't ventured far in my whiskey exploration beyond my comfort zone. 

Only a few months ago have I started being more interested in whiskey and getting into the more nerdy territory, trying to explore other whiskey types etc. 

I haven't really tried bourbon before (I used to stick mainly to Irish), so I decided to waltz down to my local whiskey shop to see if I can procure a bottle of Wild Turkey 101 (as I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about it). When I asked if they stock it, the shop assistant replied to me with a ""we don't stock cheap stuff like that"". 

That happened a few months back, and I did manage to get a hold of Wild Turkey via online means in the end. However, as I was sipping on it I remembered that encounter and it made me think: ""that surely was a pretentious response from that shop keep, and probably not a good way to respond to a customer's request"". People like that give a bad name to this community as a whole, I think.

My question to you, folks, is what's your experience with pretentiousness in the whiskey circle? What kind of statements/interactions from fellow whiskey lovers infuriate you the most?",25,2021-07-02 02:44:24

But after some search, I found some low-cost Japanese whiskey like Tenjaku, Kinuuri, Tottori Aged in Bourbon Barrel, Mars Iwai Tradition, and Nikka Super Rare which are cheaper or nearly the same price as the Green Label. I've never seen some reviews online with these brands, except for the Nikka, but the reviews for the Green Label were superior.

youlleatitandlikeit,npvm40,1,whiskey,Does anyone else prefer the regular Redbreast 12 year to the cask strength?,"Maybe it's because the normal 12 has been sitting around a while and has had time to oxidate, but I just feel like I'm getting a more rounded, more complex nose from the 80 proof. It feels like there is this sharper stronger aroma (I get the exact same smell of another one of my cask strengths). I guess I need to get into the practice of adding water; I'm generally happier with 92 proof or lower (with the exception of a few bottled-in-bonds American whiskeys that are incredibly smooth/gentle).",13,2021-06-01 22:42:57

First time posting here and i am here for a question. I need advice. I want to buy a gift for my father and since he likes whiskey i figured why not a proper one. Here is the thing tho.last year he had Covid and ever since he cant taste things that dont have strong flavours ( white wine etc ). So im looking for a strong whiskey that almost guarantees he will taste something. I know he drinks Arberg uigeadail at the moment and he loves it because he can taste it. So im looking for a strong whiskey and i know he likes a strong smokeyness. I hope this makes sense and i dont look like a fool because i dont know anything about whiskey myself. Sorry for long post. I hope people can help me",23,2021-06-02 06:05:46

And I've run out of good matchups, aside from Irish, which I did on St. Patrick's Day. 

For Scotch, I have just three - Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2011, Monkey Shoulder, and Aberlour A'Bunadh. As you'd imagine, none of these would go great head-to-head. Maybe the Bruichladdich vs the Monkey Shoulder, but I'm pretty confident the Bruichladdich would win easily. 

So - question is, do you have any recommendations for an unpeated (not a peat fan) Scotch that's similar enough to the Islay Barley, while being different enough to not be redundant? I suppose I could also do a competitor to the A'Bunadh or MS, if there's a good recommendation on that front. Appreciate your opinions!",7,2021-04-02 22:18:21

missilecommandtsd,miwzgr,1,whiskey,Need recs for 8 x $50 whiskeys for blind tasting party / vaccine celebration.,"Approx $50 ( can be more or less but def trying to stay below $100 per bottle).

This is just supposed to be fun. My Friends and I are amateurs, but whiskey fans none the less. Celebrating our vaccines. I'm thinking a March madness style bracket for each guest, to simply find their blind favorite. Is that a good method? What whiskeys would you recommend? Any other tips?

I'm fairly new to whiskys and have mostly stayed within spaeside and Highlands. My first impression with the talisker was just now punchy and distinctive each flavor profile is. I can easily pick apart the char, the fruits, caramel and that overwhelming chilli burn! I love the smoky taste and there's a fair amount of sweetness that I enjoy, however I can't say I enjoy that chili burn. Ive tasted higher proof whiskys and this is definitely not just alcohol burn. It's got that harshness that's kind of preventing me from liking an otherwise very interesting drink. Anyone have any advice as to how to take that edge off? Maybe I should try it on the rocks?",5,2021-04-04 02:04:10

105.3 proof/52.7% ABV 

Mashbill 100% rye 

Price unknown as this was a gift and a hand selected barrel from friends 

Barrel 3165
1/A/2 Rick level 

Nose: a little floral and dill, surprisingly no ethanol despite proof, tons of maple, praline, toffee, and brown butter 

Palate: oily mouthfeel, brown sugar, a little barrel char, clove and a hint of pepper, fruits throughout the Palate

Finish: long finish, brown butter,  berries, the rye spice finally shows up on the finish in force. 

Conclusions: I'm not usually a huge rye fan but I do like a handful. This is a very good rye and a dangerously easy sipper. This is a complex and well aged rye.

acsmith1972,lxdp39,3,whiskey,I need some help to find something smooth.,"For me the kind of liquors I like are the ones that go down smooth. Really smooth. Like buttery smooth. And maybe it's just my palate, or perception, but a lot of the ones I've tried just don't fit that description. And with a few liquors, my own standards don't even seem to apply. Like I can drink Yukon Jack with no problems. Something about the flavor works for me. Especially as a Snakebite.

 Years ago a bartender friend at a restaurant I worked at got me hooked on Irish Mist for a while. I now hate honey whiskeys again. But they are smooth. My go-to for cheap would be Jameson. I tried Macallan 12, and liked it enough to buy a bottle of Macallan 18, so I *do* like Macallan. I tried Laphroaig, but it tasted like someone was stilling band-aids and  iodine to me. Not a fan. I just picked up a bottle of Evan Williams White, which actually surprised me, not my favorite, but I'd put it at better than Jameson.  

I also have a bottle of Talisker Storm, which I read good things about, but, again, it has that band-aid flavor. I'll drink it at some point, but it'll be there a while. I have a bottle of Maker's Mark that'll be gone before that (it was a gift, I prefer Knob Creek to Maker's Mark). 

What I'm looking for is something that goes down smooth like say Irish Mist or even Sambuca, that has no bite at all on the back end of it. Here's my list of others to try, tell me what you think, if any of these fit the bill: Redbreast 15,  Glenfiddich 18, Auchentoshan Cooper's Reserve 14, Blair Athol 12, Glenglassaugh Evolution, Strathmill 12, Belvenie 12, Glendronach 12, Glenlivet Nadurra Oloroso, Compass Box Spice Tree, and Glenmorangie 18. I'll try a few more of the less expensive Macallans I haven't tried, too. I'm trying to stay around the $50 mark unless it's exceptional like Macallan. But even then it's easier on my budget to be able to try some of the 12s so I can try more than one and not have to sink everything into one bottle.",8,2021-03-04 13:39:27

I‚Äôve recently tried a couple different drinks however I haven‚Äôt been able to get many flavor profiles I‚Äôd say the biggest would be a oak woody Smokey smell. 

* Makers Mark - liked this one not amazing but not terrible either. some burn not much on the rocks and with Coke are my preferred for this bottle. 

* Angels Envy - decent amount of burn but good especially on the rocks. Was my first true drink so I might have to go back and revisit this one. 

* Gentlemen Jack - the smoothest in my opinion again good not great Jack &amp; Coke of course. 

* Woodford Reserve - again some burn on the rocks was pretty good. Got a lot of oak from this bottle. 

Overall I‚Äôm not sure which is my favorite or which I liked best and can‚Äôt really taste anything other than the oak maybe some vanilla. Anyone have any other suggestions? Thanks!

SolitaryEgg,l9w7o0,6,whiskey,"Opinion: I got the norlan glasses as a gift, and I think you guys are too hard on 'em","So, it finally happened. A friend gave me the norlan glasses. My initial reaction was to be thankful, obviously, but also to roll my eyes internally, as I've read everything about them here and in other enthusiast communities.

But, I was determined to give them a fair shake. So, I washed them an poured a glass of Laphroaig 10. And you know what? I *really like them.* They feel good in the hand, they are decent creating a nice nose, and they are... fun. It's just nice to drink out of a hand-blown glass, with an interesting shape and ""suspended"" inner glass. And, I really liked how the rim of the glass perfectly reflected the color of the whiskey. A gimmick, maybe, but still a really unique thing. 

But to address some of the common complaints I've seen:

**It's overpriced**

I agree. I mean it is hand blown glass, but $50 for two glasses is expensive.

**They are fragile**

Probably true. But this meme that they break when you look at them is ridiculous. Treat them like crystal, or something, and they'll be fine.

**The marketing is stupid**

Agree. This whole thing they do about using AI to produce the ultimate glass, or whatever, is nonsense. It's a glass. Chill. 

**Glencairn glasses are the same, or better**

Also agree. If you're just looking for the ultimate glass that produces a nice nose, go for Glencairn. 

But *none of this really matters.* Sure, it's overpriced. Sure, Glencairn produces a slighter nicer nose, maybe. But, so what? These glasses serve their purpose, which is to be a really cool glass. And to create a full-glass handfeel with the properties of a flute. 

I thoroughly enjoyed drinking from one, and I couldn't stop staring at it as I drank. It produced a nice nose, nice reflections, and just felt pretty fancy, if I'm being honest. It's just a neat glass, and a conversation piece. I really don't see what's wrong with that, and I think it's a shame that it's become a like a meme in this community, where anyone that uses one is an idiot, or something. I like mine, and I'll keep using them.

IllegibleLetters,l9x0w0,6,whiskey,My Whiskeys of 2020,"Here‚Äôs a very quick list of the various whisky and whiskey brands I‚Äôve tried over the course of 2020.  With more time staying in, I figured I should branch out a little bit, try bottles I‚Äôd seen or heard of but never tasted. Now, there were other, old favorites that I had at some point, so this isn‚Äôt exactly everything I drank during 2020, and these weren‚Äôt all full size 750ml bottles, but it is my list by memory of the brands I tried for the first time ever, and what I can cobble together as to why I liked or didn‚Äôt like them. 

Disclaimer: I have no palette when it comes to clearly identifying what something is like, I can‚Äôt really put into words why something tastes good, and I have a poor memory for why I liked it, which is a long way of saying that I can‚Äôt really write a good full review. This is more like my quick notes on what was good, what I was disappointed about, and suggestions for others in the same boat as me.

What I usually drink is stuff like Woodford Reserve or Basil Hayden‚Äôs, and for Scotch mostly Balvenie or Glenlivet. My typical glass is with either a splash of water or an ice cube, but that‚Äôs it, never mixed drinks other than the occasional gin and tonic in the summer. I like scotch plenty, but when it comes to spending money I just find a better value in bourbon or American whiskey options, so that makes up the majority of what I buy. I don‚Äôt venture too often into rye, Canadian or Irish whiskey, nor flavored stuff like honey this or apple that. Also, I‚Äôm vaguely trying to list these in something close to order based on when I bought them (oldest to most recent), but it‚Äôs imperfect. Not that you‚Äôd know that, but just realize I typically finish off a bottle before opening the next one, so some of these are from most of a year ago.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Proper no Twelve Irish Whiskey (80 proof)**
One of a few bottles I got from a going out of business sale last winter, so I figured I would try it. I‚Äôve not had a lot of Irish whiskeys compared to the American or Scottish options. I‚Äôm an MMA fan, so I‚Äôd seen countless ads for it. I had low expectations, but actually it more than exceeded that. This tasted quite good in my opinion, kind of standard in terms of taste but smooth enough and with some sweetness. It‚Äôs hard to compare to something I haven‚Äôt had in like 5 years, but by my recollection I didn‚Äôt like Jameson nearly as much, but I‚Äôd have to try it again someday. 


**Brenne French Single Malt Whisky (80 proof)**
This was really quite unique. It‚Äôs not cheap, but I got it on sale so I was happy with that. There‚Äôs something about it that‚Äôs very distinct, but I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it, but I liked it‚Äôs quite a lot. Maybe it was light and sweet, or maybe kind of floral? Sorry I can‚Äôt describe it better, it has been a long about 9 months or so since I finished it, but I think worth a try. Side note: beautiful bottle design. I know that‚Äôs not a reason to buy a drink, but just wanted to give some appreciation for when a brand puts in the extra effort and makes something that tastes good but also looks interesting on the shelf. 


**Mossburn Island Scotch 8 year Blended Malt Whisky (92 proof)**
Also bought on sale, but this one was disappointing (note: if you are paying attention: the same sale as the previous 2 bottles). This was had during the spring shut down, and I just recall it being harsh and underwhelming. Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt as good as the Proper No 12. I‚Äôve always tried to stay away from ‚Äúcheap‚Äù scotch since you‚Äôre paying for the import and the ‚Äúprestige‚Äù, but so often anything that‚Äôs under $30 or $40 I just find unenjoyable. But this isn‚Äôt even that cheap. Looking up just now the price, my store sells this for $46. Not to put everything as ‚Äúvalue‚Äù or ‚Äúfor the price‚Äù, but for that price range I‚Äôd much rather Aberlour or Glenlivet 12 year single malt Scotchs that are smoother, more complex choices I‚Äôve come back to several times over the years. 


**Nobushi Japan Blended Whisky (80 proof)**
This was a bottle I got at a wholesale club, and figured I would try it. I‚Äôve had a couple of Japanese whiskys over the years, but it‚Äôs not something that comes up that often compared to bourbon or Scotch. This is really distinct, but I mean that in a good way! There‚Äôs a sort of fruity and long slow finish, that I think has like a pause, and then a 2nd finish in a way. Hard to describe, but I loved it. Very good value, and if you want something different pick this up. The bottle design here is very bland, so if you think it‚Äôs boring, the whisky inside is not. I will be buying this again at some point. This sells local to me for around $35 per 750ml, and I think that‚Äôs a reasonable price for a memorable drink.


**Jack Daniel's Gentleman Jack Tennessee Whiskey (80 proof)**
Okay, not trying for a ‚Äúhot take‚Äù but I just have never been a Jack fan. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs bad exactly, but it just doesn‚Äôt jump out as either memorable or really great. So I picked up a small sample of Gentleman Jack, but wasn‚Äôt thrilled. I think this confirms Jack is for mixing with soda, not sipping neat. Of course it‚Äôs a popular, standard option that you‚Äôll literally find in like every bar around the world, but trying this just confirmed for me that I will continue to think of all versions of Jack Daniels as a brown liquor option for mixing, not as good as most of the rest of this list.  


**Four Roses Bourbon Whiskey (80 proof)**
This was a suggestion from the Reddit as a very good value bourbon, and that it is. It goes for around $15 per 750ml, and it‚Äôs maybe the best option at that price. This has become my new standard for something less expensive but smooth and really nice. It‚Äôs not exactly special, but I like it quite a lot. I kind of hate to keep saying it‚Äôs like a good value and that‚Äôs what makes it a good buy in my book. 


**Four Roses Small Batch Whiskey (90 proof)**
Ditto, but better? Maybe better is hard to say, but more complex. The higher proof does seem to come through a bit, but it‚Äôs certainly a really nice choice. Granted, I was trying to branch out this year, but this and the ‚Äúregular‚Äù Four Roses are the only ones so far that I‚Äôve bought a 2nd time this past year. I feel a little bad saying it makes me think of a standard bourbon, since some might take that to mean boring or average or not distinct. If I were to describe it that way, all I mean by it is that this is what bourbon SHOULD taste like, and you‚Äôre getting a good product out of it.  


**Monkey Shoulder 12 year Blended Scotch (86 proof)**
Here I thought that good cheap Scotch was an oxymoron, and then I go and try something like this‚Ä¶ and it totally redeems that segment. I have liked Chivas Regal before as a good option, but this does stand out as an excellent choice for a 12 year blended Scotch. I‚Äôd certainly take it over Johnnie Walker red or black (though I haven‚Äôt had either in many years so maybe I should revisit them). I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs much about it that really seems obviously a scotch vs a whiskey from somewhere else in the world, but it‚Äôs a solid option. This will become something I do buy again down the line; budget friendly but still agreeable in every sense of that word. One note, but nothing you can do about it: terrible name. I googled the why, and it‚Äôs about the condition that came from making the stuff a long time ago, so I appreciate the nod to it‚Äôs origins. Just doesn‚Äôt sound as timeless as others out there, and I‚Äôd say they might be missing a few sales based on that. 


**Elija Craig Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey (94 proof)**
Very good. Again, based on what I frequently saw people suggesting on reddit, it‚Äôs smooth and nice.  And in a way like with the Four Roses Small Batch, this is what I think of when I hear the word ‚Äúbourbon‚Äù. And for a fair value, given both the high abv (highest I had this year) while not tasting harsh. I was surprised to check the label and see how high the proof. My usual assumption is that you get more of that burn, but it‚Äôs kept in check here.  


**Jefferson‚Äôs Very Small Batch Blend Bourbon Whiskey (82.3 proof)**
This is quite a good option, yet again. Along the same lines of Elijah Craig or the Four Roses Small Batch, this is what a good bourbon should taste like to me. Smooth, but has a little bit of a bourbon kick to it, a really well made option for something to drink straight, and at a reasonable price of vaguely $25. If we had to choose, I think I‚Äôd sooner buy the FR or EC before this one next time, but from an enjoyment perspective you can‚Äôt go wrong with either in my opinion. Biggest complaint: the bottle is nice looking but terrible to actually pour, and it tends to drip due to the spout being very small. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Okay, so that‚Äôs my quick list of a few whisky and whiskey I tried during 2020. If this list sounds like too many, I promise I don‚Äôt have a problem and some of these were small bottles, or what we in Massachusetts call nips. If it sounds like too few, I did also have my share of beer and a little wine in between. My biggest pleasant surprises are maybe Four Roses and Monkey Shoulder as I may not have tried them before if not for reading what people were posting out online. If I had to break my past year into 3 price categories, I‚Äôd say ‚Äúcheap‚Äù Four Roses wins in the under $20 group, Elijah Craig in the $20-30 range, and Nobushi for the $30+ option. Obviously the only one here I was truly disappointed in was that Mossburn blended 8 year, but one less-than-stellar bottle a year is a minor price to pay for how many excellent whisky and whiskey brands are available.  

Let me know what you think, if there‚Äôs something here you agree or disagree with of course, and if you have a question I can attempt to give an answer, but as I said above I might not be the most helpful. I like what I like, and sometimes I want to return what I‚Äôve bought, but that is rare. And of course if there some recommendation based on this list, by all means tell me what to buy and I‚Äôll keep an eye out for it next time. 

Thank you!",4,2021-02-01 14:45:38

Zacigator,la2xhw,5,whiskey,First Laphroaig; need opinions,"EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! This is exactly what I was looking for; I wasn't sure if it was something I should already sort of like, or if it was an acquired taste. Clearly it's the latter, and evidently I should start with one of the milder options some of you guys have mentioned. Thanks so much!

I'm super new to whiskey. I started about 3-4 months ago, having only had Jack Daniel's and Jim Beam beforehand; I kinda liked Daniel's, and hated Beam. But then I was gifted a bottle of Buffalo Trace, and I absolutely adored it. From there I got a Glenfiddich 12; basic I know, but I really liked it a lot, although I could wish for more complexity. Got a bottle of Maker's Mark; it's okay, but tastes a bit cheaper than my BT. Got a bottle of Glenfarclas 10, really liked it too; different from Glenfiddich, but I love both (if I had to choose though, Glenfiddich wins). Got a bottle of Jameson, and I liked it well enough. Definitely tasted fruitier to me, which wasn't bad.

Then, I got my first bottle of Laphroaig (Select), and it is WILDLY different. I am extremely iffy on it, it smells like a hospital and tastes kind of like going to the dentist, I feel like. I also feel like I'm not positive what to look for or HOW to taste it. I know it's ""peaty"" and most other whiskeys aren't, but I don't know what peaty actually means either.

Any ideas or advice for a newbie to whiskey for giving it a fair shot before I write off Islay/Peated whiskeys?",20,2021-02-01 21:22:33

JazzioDadio,laodk8,2,whiskey,Results of a head to head taste test,"[I made a post about 4 whiskey's](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/laib12/told_my_dad_id_be_buying_a_scotch_this_week_since/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and had some interested parties asking for a follow up after the tastings. So I made the ""sacrifice"" and tasted all 4 of them back to back while taking some notes on the nose, taste, and finish. I'll compile them here for anyone interested in either of the whiskey's sampled!

Please keep in mind that what follows is what **I** personally was able to smell, taste, and identify. While you might get similar results, you could also get completely different results, and that's part of the beauty of whiskey. Everyone's experience will differ slightly! I'm also not a sommelier, and only got into drinking whiskey 5 or 6 months ago, so I could be misidentifying some notes.

I compared 2 bourbons, one of which was below $50, the other of which was above $100. The goal was to figure out what (if anything) makes the more expensive option a better buy. I did the exact same thing with 2 scotches. In hindsight I should have taken the bottles out of their boxes but bah, where's the fun in removing the mystery! It might also be worth mentioning that I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area in CA, so our Total Wine has a huge selection of whiskey.

The bourbons I chose:

&amp;#x200B;

[From left to right: Chestnut Farms \(over $100\) and Angel's Envy \($44\)](https://preview.redd.it/9xzi5ti0vze61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ede0e0cd8b8f4d0214cfaebe2384a759063b01)

Beginning with the Chestnut Farms BiB Bourbon:

**Nose:** muted, oaky, sweet but not in the traditional caramel/vanilla sense.

**Taste:** oaky, with a hint of spice that quickly dissipates. My dad described it as ""a firework that goes off in your mouth and then dissapears."" Vanilla with a smoothness that gradually brings a burn which sits on the lips and back of the tongue. I experienced a very pleasant tingling sensation on my lips in particular.

**Finish:** dry and oaky, nothing complicated. Allows you to sit and contemplate the amount of money you just swallowed.

Compare it to the Angel's Envy, which I had very high expectations for:

**Nose:** full bodied, with plenty of spice and sweet vanilla. Of the two, this one smelled the nicest.

**Taste:** sweet, smooth, caramel, maple syrup. It's only 43% ABV so it kicks noticeably less.

**Finish:** bittersweet chocolate, long and low.

It might not be obvious from the notes but these two bourbons were surprisingly distinct, they could have been two completely different types of whiskey. That being said, I think the Angel's Envy gives you a lot more to experience for a very reasonable price. I'd have no problem shelling out for the uniqueness of the Chestnut Farms, but it's a much purer bourbon, and in being so lacks the diversity in smell and taste provided by the Angel's. **I rate both in the uper 10% of bourbon's I've tried so far**.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up, the scotch whiskeys I chose:

&amp;#x200B;

[From left to right: The Macallan 15 Double Cask \($120 or so\) and Glenfiddich 12 \($34\)](https://preview.redd.it/byoytgdtwze61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c708b5f1aa21200413df720498c2c70d7306e36)

Beginning with The Macallan:

**Nose:** sweet, oak, toffee (this was the primary note for me), pear with an earty tone (the secondary note). Surprisingly complex without being obnoxiously so.

**Taste:** like a cap gun, the toffee and oaky fruitiness goes off with a *bang* in your mouth and quickly dissipates, leaving a slight burn on your tongue or back of the palate, with residual sweetness. Not quite as smooth as the Glenfiddich but still easy to swallow.

**Finish**: sweet, subtle, and lingering. Not as dry as the others, and there's nothing new or crazy that comes out in the finish. It's pleasant, and like the Chestnut Farms gives you some time to think about how much money you've swallowed.

Compared to the Glenfiddich 12:

**Nose:** sweet, undeniably pear. Carries a hint of the typical ""scotch smell.""

**Taste:** sweet, fruity, buttery smooth. Hint of oak. Slowly brings on a burn that sits on the tongue.

**Finish:** sweet, maintains fruitiness. Not very long, flavors go away almost dissapointingly quickly.

This was a much more even match. I admittedly have quite a bit of bias since this exact Glendfiddich was my first exposure to scotch a couple months ago which I immediately loved, but I'm also a fan of The Macallan as an icon in pop culture (Jeff Winger's go-to whiskey throughout the entire show Community is The Macallan 18, neat.) In the end, I have to go with value and say that for the price, you'd be hard pressed to beat Glenfiddich 12. It's fruity and fun, dangerously smooth, and shockingly low priced. The Macallan takes the same flavors and gives them some maturity, adding depth and dignity to them, which makes for a wonderful experience, if a bit of an expensive one.

&amp;#x200B;

Once it's all said and done, I consider them all to be really good whisky, any of which I'd drink in a heartbeat. That being said, and with the full knowledge that knowing what they cost forms a bias, when I buy these again, I don't think I'll be buying the more expensive versions. While both the Chestnut Farms and The Macallan 15 Double Cask have some wonderfully unique experiences in each sip, I can't justify the price. They're good, but not so much better that they're worth more than twice as much. The bottles are gorgeous, I'll give them that much.

Angel's Envy surprised me by living up to and then exceeding my expectations for a port barrel aged bourbon. I didn't expect it to be so smooth or have such depth of flavor, so I'm definitely adding that to my ""buy this bourbon"" list. And I'm excited to see how it acts in an old fasioned or manhattan!

If you're looking into trying a scotch, I cannot recommend Glenfiddich 12 enough. This scotch alone is what's preventing me from calling myself a bourbon drinker. The Speyside distilleries produce some delicious whiskeys that come out smooth, sweet, and simple. Nothing complicated or dynamic, no weird flavors or unexpected textures, just sweet, smooth, fruity deliciousness. The Speyside region used to be part of the Highland, which takes up most of Scotland. It became its own region most likely due to the fact that despite being so small it contains most of the distilleries in the country. To quote Raymond Reddington from the show The Black List ""If you'd be so kind as to pick out a single malt... a highland, isla water tastes like seaweed and iodine."" I've tried a Johnny Walker or two and a disgusting mixed scotch called Creag Isle, and this little $30 bottle of single malt blows them all away.",0,2021-02-02 13:24:31

TheRealHyveMind,kp7t0y,1,whiskey,How can you drink this stuff?!,"Now, granted that's a fairly click bait title and granted also, asking that here of all places is really not the best first impression I'm sure but I'm actually looking for some advice.

You see my only experiences with whiskey so far had been terrible. I'm aware that it may just not be the drink for me, but I really feel I ought to give it a fair shot before I just go another route.

You see I've tried a few, mostly just off the shelf brands that likely don't do whiskey any justice but I'm not really wanting to sink a small fortune into a bottle that may otherwise end up down the sink.

I've tried Bells many, many years ago and I'm aware that Bells is basically the toilet water of whiskey. I've also tried Jack Daniels and that was alright, but certainly not nice enough to pick over something else.

I recently went and picked up some taster bottles, the little two serving types of Talisker, and that, even on the rocks, tasted like I was drying to drain petrol from my car.

Now I'm not much of a big spirit guy anymore. My years of university and vodka have put me off some spirits, but I really like the warm feeling, and the strong tastes of spirits but whiskey has so far been absolutely horrific.

I'm wondering then if anyone has any off the shelf recommendations that are actually very flavourful. I'm based in the UK so ideally something off the shelf from Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons would be ideal.

I want that warm feeling from the drink, but maybe something a little more sweet, maybe fruity, just something with a strong flavour rather than just the taste of pure burning barrels.

But... it might be that's how whiskey is. Might just not be the drink for me and if people don't have much of a recommendation then I'll have to give up on my dreams of being a sophisticated, classy whiskey drinker.

Aby advice or help would be wonderful. Thank yoy kind folk!",8,2021-01-03 06:54:57

But, be it by accident, I try this again and it was actually pretty damn good. 

My Scotch of choice is Glenfiddich 12, so obviously this one was great different. A polar opposite, if I do say so myself. 

When poured under the tongue instead of above it, when taking a sip, you are hitting immediately with a potent peat flavor, which is manageable and suppressed to respectable amount by the fact that it's under your tongue and that on it. Is it close your mouth and lower your tongue, as the alcohol rises around the sides to the top, you'll be faced with a strong charcoal taste followed by alcohol vapor, before it lands on top of the much more mild, but strong flavor of strong cherry and fresh oak.

If you just sip it and drink it straight down, the flavor can be very overwhelming to people not used to strong taste, but when sipped in directly and left to sit in your mouth for a second, given the opportunity the flavors will separate out and create an incredibly pleasant drink even if drank neat. Glenfiddich 12 is still my favorite Scotch by far, but surprisingly considering I thought I hated this, I would strongly consider drinking it casually in the future, perhaps if with just a splash of water. 

Flavor profile: 
-peat
-Charcoal
-Fresh cherries
-Fresh oak",0,2021-01-03 18:27:26

oishii_uisuki,kpuiw8,1,whiskey,A Discussion About Sourced Whisk(e)y + Japanese Whisky,"This wonderful gent over at r/WhiskeyTribe made this fun info graph and I offered to share what I know about Japanese whisky. It took me a long time to write so I figured I'd share and open up a discussion on sourced whiskies. 

\_\_\_

I wanted to paint an entire picture for you before you go making a chart that people start relying on. It's important to note a lot of things that get overly simplified, probably because there's not too much info out there. If you'd like to learn more about ""legit"" Japanese whisky producers on an individual level, feel free to ask (didn't go into it for the sake of time). Whisky Rising by Stefan Van Eycken and The Way of Whisky by Dave Broom are amazing resources for anyone that wants to learn more. 

**JP WHISKY LAWS**

First thing to note: ""making whisky"" is Japan is a very vague concept. Japan has officially been making whisky for less than 100 years. Before that, it was trial and error, and honestly nothing similar to what we would define as whisky today. Additionally, who knew Japanese whisky would blow up in the way that it did? Now that is has, we have people who ARE making whisky, and we have even more people who have found loopholes and are selling sourced whisky AS ""Japanese whisky"". It is very hard to draw the line of who's ""making whisky for right/wrong reasons"", and this is probably why the Japanese government hasn't really done anything about it. But now we have [Whisky Associations that are stepping up to make this change themselves .](https://www.nomunication.jp/2019/09/09/twsc-details-japanese-whisky-requirements/) The Tokyo Whisky and Spirits Competition is organized by them and if you want to enter, you must follow their requirements: Mashing of the grain and saccharification (without Koji - see ""Shochu Vs Whisky paragraph), fermentation, distillation, and 2+ year aging must \*all take place in Japan\*. Blending or bottling can take place outside of Japan which is interesting!

The only real law regarding Japanese whisky is ""your establishment needs to have a whisky license"". Which just means that you can house whisky, doesn't emphasize on the production aspect. But even though there are no laws, the respectable Japanese whisky distillers typically follow scotch law: Aged min 3 years, min 40% ABV, and obv made in Japan.

Your current definition of Japanese whisky that you put in the new graph says ""1) Whisky distilled from cereal grains 2) Aged in wooden barrels"". I believe this is the US's definition of whisky. This comes into play when we look at the aged shochu category, aka Rice Whisky. 

**SHOCHU VS WHISKY**

Real quick ELI5: think of shochu as distilled sake (brewed rice beverage that has ABV similar to wine). Except it can be made with any grain - barley, potato, rice, sugarcane, buckwheat, and some ppl also use unique things like tomatoes. It can be distilled once or twice. BUT the important thing to note is that Shochu (like sake) DOES NOT UNDERGO THE MALTING PROCESS. Instead of creating sugar via soaking/drying/germination, [you get a mold spore called Koji to do it for you.](https://cultures.group/making-koji-malting/) 

In Japan, ""Shochu aged in barrels"" is not synonymous with ""whisky"" - that \*is\* a law. Shochus are strictly regulated, so much to the point where you can't have aged shochu be darker than a certain color, but I don't have time to get into that. So Barrel Aged Shochu =/= whisky... In Japan. 

In the US, you can call it ""whisky"" because it's a ""cereal grain aged in barrels"". Fukano and Ohishi are examples of this and are often referred to as Rice Whiskies, but it's v v important to remember that the spirit making process is majorly different! That being said - when tasting these, don't compare them to whisky. That's not fair to the spirit. If you need to compare it to anything, think of it as distilled sake, while also noting that the rice will not taste the same as a corn/rye/wheat whisk(e)y.

**SOURCING WHISKY**

***Y'all, Sourced Whisky =/= Bad Whisky.*** If there's a take home message here, this is it. 

Deception is never good, but sourced whisky does not equate to bad whisky. It definitely can be, but that's not always true. But alas, deception and sourced whisky sadly usually are often times associated with each other. 

Remember, sourcing whisky has been around since the beginning of whisky making history. If you are insistent that ""sourced = bad"", I will immediately assume you just spew stuff that you've been told without doing research. And that's understandable, because a lot of liquor brands use that as a marketing tool these days. Scotch and Irish whiskies have a long history of sourcing and sharing whiskies. And you'll see it in Canada and the US too. Hell, half the bourbon market comes from the midwest even though it says ""Kentucky, Vermont, Colorado, etc"" on the label. And it's situations like this where we see people jump to the conclusions that ""sourced whiskies are bad"" because they feel deceived, and I don't blame them. You tell Texans that Tito's Vodka is not made in Austin and they get defensive. I get it. 

Sourced whisky \*CAN\* be bad. As I showcased in the last few sentences. Deception sucks, and we don't like being lied to. But you know how I said Japanese whisky laws weren't put into place because no one thought it would become such big deal? I imagine that happened with some brands too. Let's say decades ago, you started sourcing Indiana white dog and aging it at your warehouse (most likely because you couldn't afford to set up a distillery because it's, well, REALLY expensive). You probably didn't realize people would care so much years later. The emphasis on craft products and authenticity has totally reshaped the whiskey market to where it is today. People care now. People want authentic products. That's why you see more and more brands being transparent about sourcing, because that's not going away. From a financial standpoint, many people have to source because it's the only economical option. What the brand decides to do from there is on them. There's exceptions to everything that I'm saying but people need to realize all this before they go saying ""SOURCED IS BAD"". It can be!! Totally can. But don't generalize cuz not everything is black and white. Oversimplifying anything makes it easier to digest, but understand that there's a lot more to sourcing than ""people are trying to trick you"". Not to mention, your local distillery will probably use this as an easy, lazy sales pitch to deter you away from the competition (and you should support local, all I'm saying is that this is an easy sales pitch that I encounter all the time). 

ANYWAY. Back to Japan. Here's where we see lots of examples of where sourced whisky can be bad. ""Japan has no whisky laws, so why not source a bunch of whisky, teaspoon whatever Japanese distillate if we wanna be extra fancy, and export that as ""Japanese Whisky""? We'll make a lot more money on selling scotch/canadian whisky as Japanese whisky that way..."". This is what's happening in the Japanese whisky world and this is very problematic. Not only are you lying to people, but you're straight up taking advantage of the hype and scarcity of Japanese whisky. Again, Japan didn't know Japanese whisky would get the insane hype that it's getting today (which stems from all the recognitions/World Whiskies Awards these Japanese whiskies received over the last 2 decades), so a lot of them ran out of stock. It is aged spirit, which takes time. Also, let's say you are one of the poor individuals that bought into one of these sourced ""Japanese"" whiskies. Chances are, it wasn't that great. That gives Japanese whisky a bad name too. If this happened to you, didn't you think to yourself ""wow, Japanese whisky is really overrated. That sucked"". That's unfair to the real producers who are working hard to make delicious whiskies. But if you did buy a sourced Japanese whisky and you liked it, then great! From a consumer perspective, that's honestly what matters most in end.

When discussing sourced Japanese whiskies, people often mention Matsui Shuzo. When they started out in 2016, there was no physical distillery yet they had these age statement Kurayoshi whiskies ranging from 8-22+ years in age. People also like to emphasize the fact that the packaging looks a lot like Suntory whiskies, lol. Anyway, how are there age statement whiskies when there is no distillery? Simple: It was sourced from elsewhere; it just has a Japanese-looking label on it. Matsui ended up getting a ton of heat for this, so they eventually built a distillery. Though they are releasing their own stuff now under ""Matsui Whisky"", they are calling the new whiskies ""Single Malts"" despite being less than a year old. Again, no law to stop them, but the respectable distilleries would refer to this as a [""New Born"" whisky; which is anything under than 2 years old according to TWSC](https://www.nomunication.jp/2019/09/09/twsc-details-japanese-whisky-requirements/). As I mentioned earlier, respectable distilleries follow scotch laws. We see new producers like Akkeshi and Kanosuke releasing their newer single malts as New Born whiskies. 

So if this is ""bad, sourced whisky"", what the heck is ""good, sourced whisky""?!?! Obviously, this is all subjective, but in my eyes, good, sourced whisky = sourced whisky that is being used as a tool. This is the example I always use: Nikka by the Barrel. Won #1 from Whisky Advocate a couple years ago. Nikka is one of the OG distilleries and the founder is one of the reasons why Japanese whiskies exists today. Nikka owns 2 main Japanese Whisky distilleries: Yoichi and Miyagikyo (if you haven't tried these, you are missing out). They also own Ben Nevis Distillery in Scotland. Nikka by the Barrel (from my understanding) is a blend of Nikka Japanese whisky and Ben Nevis scotch whisky. To me, this is a prime example of good, sourced whisky; it's being used as a tool to achieve an intentional, desired flavor profile. And based on these whisky subreddits, yall love this stuff. Another example is Mars Distillery. They make plenty of their own whiskies but they have a line called Lucky Cat. From my understanding, they use sourced whiskies (as a tool) to achieve a certain flavor profile that they can't meet on their own. The Lucky Cat whiskies are named after individual cats owned by the President of Mars Distillery, and each whisky flavor profile is carefully curated to match the cat's personality (it's super wholesome and cute). There's also only a couple thousand bottles of each SKU made so I assume it's more of a fun homage to the pets - not deception. Meanwhile, Suntory owns Laphroaig, Auchentoshan, Bowmore, etc - they use some scotch for Ao, their ""world whisky"" (which imo, is a blatant knockoff of Ichiro's Malt Malt &amp; Grain, lol). [Punch Magazine recently wrote an article about this concept too.](https://punchdrink.com/articles/world-blend-whiskey-has-passport-will-travel-high-west-chichibu/) It's very hard to distinguish who's doing it for experimentation vs who's just trying to profit. It's based off your personal research, knowledge, and interpretation. 

I see that [Nommunication post](https://www.nomunication.jp/2018/07/06/infographic-japanese-whisky-real-or-fake/) being circulated all the time and it's a decent guide. My big issue with it that the author (who does his research and he's VERY informative, please don't get me wrong) doesn't really address the issue with sourcing. It's either ""it's good bc it's entirely made in Japan"" or ""it's sourced and bad"". If you read anything I typed above, I think this simplified narrative leaves out a lot of important information and curates this unnecessary negativity towards a topic that is very much so ingrained in the history of whisky making. If you follow his blog as much as I do, there's more that is revealed, but I usually see people treating this graphic as the Japanese whisky bible. It's not. I actually was grabbing a bottle of Mars Iwai off the shelf a few years back and the guy working at the liquor store told me that was ""fake Japanese whisky"", referring to the initial infographic that was made. Me knowing a lot about Japanese whisky challenged this idea and explained to him that this was definitely made in Nagano at a legit distillery. Someone later corrected the author and he made the 2nd chart. But that's super unfair to Mars considering they did nothing wrong, not to mention, a newer variation of this whisky was listed in Whisky Advocate's top 20 last year. But I don't blame anyone, because as I keep emphasizing, there's not much info on Japanese whiskies in general.

That being said, this chart is almost correct (to my knowledge at least). Some mistakes I see are Kaiyo being labeled as authentic Japanese whisky (it's definitely not), Akashi being labeled as inauthentic (the one that is exported to the US is, the Japanese version has molasses I think, therefore its not), Yamazakura was sourced at one point and no longer is. Again, there's so much change happening and smoke in mirrors that this sort of thing is totally inevitable. Also, this chart doesn't define Japanese whisky. Which is fair because as we determined, there is no real definition for it, but he did have to categorize these somehow to create the chart. I'd like to know if it was sorted by things like ""has a distillery"", ""age statement is X"" etc. Also, we don't know which producers are being transparent or not. For example, the Kaiyo whisky has multiple, evolving stories that defend why it's authentic (it's not, despite the defensive arguments). Another example (which is entirely my speculation, I have no proof): I don't think SOME of the Suntory and Nikka whiskies are 100% Japanese distillate anymore. With the insane demand, especially now, there's no way they can keep up. Nikka recently underwent a recipe change for Taketsuru Pure Malt which is where my theory came about. I speculate whether Toki is truly Japanese because, well, it's not impressive, lol (I know, it's just really young). Anyway, this chart is very helpful and this is just me ranting, but my point keeps being ""it's not all black and white, there are exceptions and explanations for everything"". 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**JAPANESE WHISKY HISTORY**

Let's start with the OG Crew:

**Shinjiro Torii -** Founder of Suntory Distillery (est. 1923)

**Masataka Taketsuru -** Founder of Nikka Distillery (est. 1934); also co-founded Suntory Distillery

**Kiichiro** **Iwai** **-** Founder of Mars Distillery (est. 1949); Masataka Taketsuru's mentor and Taketsuru was at one point engaged to Iwai's daughter. 

\~

This is the lore that I was taught from several sources whom are affiliated with these brands:

The first ever introduction to whisky is when Commodore Perry brings it (as a gift?) to Japan during the Meiji Era. By the end of the shogunate in 1868, the Japanese are aware of ""western liquor"". How it's made? No idea. However, Japan is making shochu which is their own distilled spirit during this time (distilled once in pot stills). Column stills were imported into Japan in the very early 1900s. 

The year is 1917 and whisky is still a mystery in terms of how it's made. A man by the name of Kiichiro Iwai is interested in creating authentic whisky and sends his about-to-be son-in-law (at the time), Masataka Taketsuru, to Scotland, where he would study at various establishments: University of Glasgow, Bo'Ness Distillery, Longmorn, Hazelburn, among others. He stayed with a Scottish host family there, the Cowans, and took detailed reports on his findings and observations of whisky making which eventually became the ""Taketsuru Note"". Taketsuru returned to Japan in 1920 with all the information they needed to open a whisky distillery... in addition to his new wife, Rita, one of the daughters of the Cowan host family. This eventually led to a falling out with the Iwai family. 

Meanwhile, another legend by the name of Shinjiro Torii was specializing in the world of exported spirits. During WWI, the Japanese economy flourished and in came an influx of western liquor and Mr. Torii had a growing interest in foreign booze, especially wine and brandy. His growing curiosity for spirits paired with an accidental encounter of spirits left in a barrel led to his desire to open a whisky distillery. But there was no one who knew how to make whisky like the Europeans... until now! 

How did all these gentlemen meet? One thing's for sure - they all are affiliated with Settsu Shuzo, a company specializing in industrial/commercial and western-style liquor. Iwai worked here for many years before becoming for an advisor for Hombo Shuzo (a company specializing in various wines and spirits... now famously known as Mars Distillery). Taketsuru also worked here as a chemist after Iwai introduced him to the owner of Settsu Shuzo. Torii was one of Iwai's clients who was purchasing supplies for his own experiments. Super small world!

Fast forward to 1923. Taketsuru is employed under Mr. Torii and they open up Japan's first ever whisky distillery: Suntory Yamazaki. Taketsuru eventually branched off to open his own distillery in northern Japan (where the climate is more similar to Scotland) called Nikka Yoichi. Mr. Iwai, who owned the rights to the Taketsuru Note, helped the Hombo family open Mars Distillery in 1949. The rest is history!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**So who's legit?** The common theme of this whole post is: there is no official definition so we have to keep defining things ourselves. There's ""legitimate"" in that they have a real distillery, proper permits, making their own whiskies, etc. And there's ""legit"" which is the term I decided to coin for this reddit post as ""anyone who has a physical distillery in Japan with the intention of making authentic product""... aka ""who do I respect and who's whisky will I support and drink?"". How do you draw the line of who has good intentions without the brand making a statement about it/talking to the producers themselves, finding skeletons in a closet and realizing that it was just marketing to sell sourced whisky? All of this is subjective in concept and limited to my knowledge of the distilleries; my respect for a distillery could change entirely based on what I learn over time. 

**Legitimate Producers** \- companies with physical distilleries. Possibility of previously sourced whiskies but are making product of their own now:

Nikka, Ichiro's Malt (Chichibu), Akashi (Eigashima/White Oak), Mars, Kanosuke, Akkeshi, Suntory, Fuiji Gotemba, Shizuoka, Okayama, Nukada, Asaka, Saburomaru (Wakatsuru)... hopefully I'm not forgetting anyone. Some of these do not export out of Japan just FYI

No one asked but my favorites: Nikka, Ichiro's Malt (Chichibu), Akashi (Eigashima/White Oak), Mars, Kanosuke, Akkeshi, Suntory (in no special order).

While not whisky, I do support Fukano (rice shochu) and Ohishi (rice shochu) too.

In case you're wondering why support rice shochu being marketed as whisky? That's because I take their shochu history into consideration. These are some very well respected producers in Kumamoto (especially Ohishi) and make some wonderful products. I initially thought they were sketch because, well, I technically don't consider it to be whisky (bc the Koji) yet it's being sold as ""whisky"". 

But coming from a liquor background, it makes sense to import it as whisky to appeal to the American market - because by US law, it \*is\* a whisky, even though it's not in Japan. And if someone imported the same thing but had ""aged shochu"" written on the label, I assure you almost no one would buy it - because it's ""too foreign"" and no one knows what shochu is. But it's \*similar enough\* to whisky that if someone who likes whisky tried it, they might like it. You might learn later that it's a shochu, but now you know you like shochu. As a Japanese person, I have a bias towards supporting Japanese products so I *want* people to get into shochu. It's a weird, cool thing that gets overshadowed by whisky and sake. Is this deceiving? Yes, totally, and I can see why it might be hard to understand my justification for it, given everything else that I've said. But I see this more of a ""ask for forgiveness not permission"" opportunity that can open up an entirely new category of spirits that you otherwise would have never tried.

However, I‚Äôve never gotten the same bug for scotch. It‚Äôs always way too sweet, or too smoky for my tastes. I find the smoky scotches sort of interesting but overpowering. And the sweet scotches just taste like cognac or something. 

Just about the only scotch that I truly enjoy is Johnnie Walker Black, which I know makes me a basic bitch as far as scotch is concerned. 

But there has to be some scotches out there that I‚Äôd like. The problem is the scotch world is huge and complex. Anyone have any pointers to help me find some scotch that isn‚Äôt gross?  Thanks!",15,2020-12-05 05:52:29

My issue is that I am not much of a drinker. The last time I had a drink before November was in January. I just do not enjoy the taste of the ethanol and the burn you get when drinking spirits. 

So Last week I bought a bottle of Elijah Craig small batch. I live in Canada so the kind I bought was only 93 proof which is the highest proof alcohol I have ever had. So far I have drank half the bottle and still cannot get past the taste of the alcohol.

 I do enjoy the sweet taste of the whisky and can identify the caramel and vanilla notes as well as the taste of the oak barrel. I just do not think I would buy another bottle. Should I continue with my whisky experience or is this a sign to just stop and stick to beer?",41,2020-12-05 07:48:35

If anyone can ID it or give me some suggestions for something really similar to replace it I'd really appreciate it. 

Why I love this glass/what I'm looking for in a replacement:

\- VERY heavy base - I just weighed the broken glass and it's 1lb 5oz empty

\- straight glass (doesn't curve/lean in or out)

\- rim is flat rather than super rounded - something about that just feels classy or expensive haha

\- very minimal design, I don't love the heavy glasses with the bubbles etc on the bottom. Also like the dished/meniscus design at the bottom of the glass",0,2020-11-04 10:32:43

Johnny Walker red - gross.

Went to get Buffalo Trace upon a Redditor‚Äôs recommendation under that post but they were out. I called a buddy who owns a bar and has a large selection of whiskey, and he recommended Four Roses as another good ‚Äúget back on the horse‚Äù option.  First couple of days were a little rough but I can finally enjoy it without my body (physically and not from taste) wanting to expel it. 

I finished that bottle of Four Roses and bought a bottle of Buffalo Trace tonight. I‚Äôm on my first dram and I have to say I wasn‚Äôt expecting how sweet the finish would be. It‚Äôs almost like a smoked brown sugar finish. I‚Äôm going to have no issue finishing this bottle but for my next bottle I‚Äôm thinking something more smoky than sweet and maybe a little brighter (if that makes any sense, idk the whiskey terminology) and was looking for recommendations.

TLDR; seeking recommendations for a person that sips their whiskey over Ice. Enjoyed Four Roses, finds Buffalo Trace too sweet and wants something more smoky and bright preferably in the $20-$35 range",10,2020-11-07 10:10:25

youkidsnyourdrugs,jpm49w,1,whiskey,"Friday, payday, great night","I've been looking forward to picking up the makers mark 46. The Glenlivet 12 came in a box with 2 The Glenlivet tumbler glasses for ~$50 and I'm newer to scotch. I have a bottle of Ardbeg and wanted to taste the difference between the two. 
The makers mark Bose was initially just hot! I might have been impatient but gave it another 10 minutes. Hot and some vanilla. The palate was again hot and bold, to me at least. I nosed again and that's when I smelled maple syrup and brown sugar. I am new an building up my palate. Another sip and I could pick out the vanilla and maybe caramel. Bold as hell. I haven't had too much bourbon but the 46 was a bold one. The finish was nice and warm. I liked that it kind of stuck to my mouth. Super impressed with the 46. It's my first Marker's mark bottle. 
So I got the Glenlivet and I could not wait. On the nose very floral. The box said fruityness and I kind of picked it up. Way different from my Ardbeg! So the palate was sweet. Was not expecting that. Sweet and heat is what my novice palate got. I was super excited to conpare taste with Ardbeg. It's the only other scotch I had and I'm newer to scotch. Picked up a bottle of Johnnie Walker black label a few weeks ago and it was a hell of a shock as I didn't realize it was scotch. So from there I got the Ardbeg and now the Glenlivet. 
So the Ardbeg has the leather or bandaid nose. I wasn't a huge fan at first but now I'm getting used to it. So very different from the Glenlivet. Looking to try the different scotches. The Ardbeg is an Oslay and the Glenlivet is a Speyside. Overall I enjoyed both. Being a Friday and having some extra I had a few glasses of the Glenlivet. I like to drink my whiskey neat. As a night cap a made my first hot toddy. I think the Glenlivet was a nice choice for that drink. Excited to keep exploring the world of whisk(e)y!",1,2020-11-07 14:36:03

Angeredlizardguy,j58i4o,1,whiskey,All whiskey tastes oxidized to me?,"For a little bit of context, I‚Äôm 22 and enjoy drinking liquor a little bit too much. I have worked at a liquor store since I‚Äôve turned 21 and enjoy every type of liquor straight except for vodka and whiskey. I have always wanted to enjoy whiskey as most of my family and friends do, but I have a few issues every time I drink it. After a very small amount I get irregularly intoxicated, it tastes heavily like cardboard (which I know is usually associated with oxidized bottles), and I get extremely nauseas and puke. The owner of the liquor store I work at is a huge whiskey guy and wanted to figure out why this was, so he gave me a blind taste test. I had multiple types of liquor consisting of brandy, cognac, rye whiskey, Irish whiskey, scotch, and bourbon. There was also some things like red wines that are very oak heavy mixed in to see if my issue is with oak. I absolutely loved the cognac, brandy, wine, etc. but all of the whiskeys tasted very similar, and all like cardboard to me. He couldn‚Äôt figure out what is making me taste it that way since all of the whiskeys I tasted are made in different ways and with different ingredients.

My question is, have any of you ever heard of this or know someone else who is like this? And also, is there anything off the top of your head that goes into only whiskey and not other types of alcohol that might be causing this for me? I really want to get into whiskey, and I pride myself on enjoying almost every food and drink I try in one way or another, but I just can‚Äôt make that happen with whiskeys.",4,2020-10-05 07:03:10

Library_of_Spirits,j5ihcn,1,whiskey,This post is for whisky lovers that never heard the famous whisky speech by Noah Sweat back in 1954. Must read!,"Noah S. Sweat ‚Äì The Whiskey Speech

Sweat was a member of the Mississippi legislature when he gave this speech in 1954. The ""Whiskey Speech"" concerned  the question of the prohibition of alcoholic liquor, a law that was still in force in Mississippi at the time the speech was delivered.

My friends, I had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time. However, I 
want you to know that I do not shun controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at 
any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it might be. You have asked me how I feel about 
whiskey. All right, here is how I feel about whiskey:
If when you say whiskey you mean the devil's brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster, that 
defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty, yea, literally 
takes the bread from the mouths of little children; if you mean the evil drink that topples the Christian 
man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous, gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation, 
and despair, and shame and helplessness, and hopelessness, then certainly I am against it.
But, if when you say whiskey you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale 
that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on 
their lips, and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer; if you mean 
the stimulating drink that puts the spring in the old gentleman's step on a frosty, crispy morning; if you 
mean the drink which enables a man to magnify his joy, and his happiness, and to forget, if only for a 
little while, life's great tragedies, and heartaches, and sorrows; if you mean that drink, the sale of 
which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars, which are used to provide tender care for 
our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, our pitiful aged and infirm; to build highways

I have an amateur question.
If I buy a bottle of whiskey (any whiskey), if I was to pour it into the wood barrel, would the aging process continue? Could I actually get a better or great whiskey I was to put few bottles in a barrel and leave it for next 10years?

The whiskeys/whiskies I've found it in are: Michter's American, Maker's Mark, Bulleit Bourbon, and Bunnahabhain 12.
I'm not sure if these ""spicy"" notes are oak spice, rye, or something else, but the one time I tried Bulleit Rye, I didn't enjoy the spicy notes.
I also haven't compared them side-by-side, like the Scotch next to the American yet to see if they are the same spice or something different, but maybe you know already?

Can anyone recommend some decent Whiskeys (any type, I think she likes scotch though) that are available and are around the $60 price range per bottle?

I was looking at Highland Park 18 and Deanston 18, although these were just recommended by another friend as generally good whiskeys (I have very little knowledge about whiskey). Money isn‚Äôt really a concern from what I‚Äôve seen price wise (I‚Äôm ok splurging for his 50th), although anything near/over 200 should be a slam dunk; I would hate to spend that much on a bottle and have it be not liked.",10,2020-07-07 00:21:29

xFreeZeex,hmftzo,3,whiskey,Need help identifying a whiskey i drank,"A few weeks ago I was visiting a friend whose parents are very into whiskey. I have absolutely no idea about whiskey, but they offered me some and I accepted. I tried two different whiskeys, one was (to my completely uneducated palate) rather light and more ""fruity"", the other one was veeeeery smoky, I remember like 20 minutes after I drank it I still had a smoky taste in my throat. The second one kinda fascinated me and I want to get a bit more into Whisky (ordered a Glencairn glass and a Buffalo Trace Burbon which arrives tomorrow, I'm excited about that but I think that's it for the start, can't afford to spend much more now lol), so I'm wondering what it was. Before I left I remember I asked them which Whiskeys I drank, one was a Smokehead and the other a Scarabus. They also talked about Ardbeg but I don't think I tried one. Could someone offer a guess on if the Smokehead or the Scarabus was the smoky one? Thanks!",12,2020-07-07 04:29:43

phrasewarden,hnaz77,1,whiskey,Review 3: Starward Nova,"\#3 **Starward Nova (41%) (Australian single malt)**

I know nothing about this whisky, so this might as well be a blind tasting, except for the ABV of 41% (which is kind of an odd %, to begin with):

**Nose**: Smells like a Scotch Speyside: sweet, honey, floral, similar to Glenmorangie 10, to me. There‚Äôs a deeper sweet note in there, though. Actually, it may be a deep spicy note. A little like Play-Doh, actually. I can‚Äôt really place it. No alcohol burn at all. It‚Äôs a nice nose.

**Taste**: Sweet and sour. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot going on, the nose was more enigmatic. A little bitter (maybe some reviewers would say oaky), after a while in the mouth, and just a bit of tongue tingling.

**Finish**: Fairly short, sweet, thick feeling, a little drying, a little spice. Very smooth; hardly feel it go down.

**Overall**: Pleasant. I have no idea of the price point‚Ä¶ wait, I‚Äôll look it up‚Ä¶ oof. $42. For $14 less, I‚Äôd get the Glenmorangie. Oh! It‚Äôs Australian, 2 years in (red wine) barrels (that may be the note I smelled). They claim long finish, I beg to differ. It is certainly enjoyable, very easy to drink. But that‚Äôs a pretty high price point, I think.",0,2020-07-08 13:05:08
phrasewarden,hnazqn,1,whiskey,Review 4: Kavalan Distillery Select,"\#4 **Kavalan Distillery Select (40%) (Taiwan single malt)**

I also know very little about this whisky, except that it is rather expensive, and well-thought-of.

**Nose**: Oh! Sharp, strong honey. Over-ripe cantaloupe? Fruity, certainly, but what fruit? And there‚Äôs another note I cannot place, but it is maddeningly familiar‚Ä¶ Rolling the glass around, I do get some alcohol burn.

**Taste**: Fruity, a little spice, but it disappears quickly, creamy.

**Finish**: Sweet creamy, a little like a dessert. A little bitter at the end. Finish moderately long. 

**Overall**: Quite nice actually, I haven‚Äôt tasted another whisky quite like this. I looked at the price point; at $50 it‚Äôs a little dear, I‚Äôd probably pay $40 for it, as I do for Glendronach 12. Surprisingly, no age statement on this whisky.",0,2020-07-08 13:06:15

These days, I seem to notice more Glenfiddich posts than usual. In the past, there were a ton of Buffalo Trace products posts. 

It could be luck and/or ""inertia"" (someone posts X product, then person 2 feels like posting about the same product, then persons 3-4 do the same, etc...), but I wonder if there is any kind of astroturfing going on sometimes.

pensivetwat,hny09j,1,whiskey,Will age statement Japanese whisky stock ever get to a point where normal people can buy it without resorting to grossly inflated secondary prices?,"It's no secret that Japanese whisky- and primarily the age statement stuff- has experienced an astronomic rise in popularity in recent years. Bottles which once sat on shelves and could be had for +/-$100 are now completely inaccessible and mostly bought up speculators and collectors who will never open them. Everyone can of course spend their money how they please, but I wonder if you guys think these age stated Japanese whiskies- particularly by Suntory and Nikka- will ever get to a point where they're accessible again? I know that they allegedly had to discontinue age stated stuff due to immense demand and give the distillate time to mature to the point it can be sold as 12, 18, whatever, year old again, and I get that of course... but at the same time, I've seen bottles of age statement Suntory stuff routinely popping up all over the world- and new bottlings no less... I assure you 12 or 18 years haven't passed since it was rumoured they'd discontinue age statements lol- this was just a year or so ago. So what happens? Misinformation meant to up the demand and thus the prices? Will this stuff ever be regularly available again, or has that ship long sailed? I'd love nothing more than to try a couple of these whiskies, but as it currently stands, it's simply not possible for me. I've no doubt Yamazaki 18 ($800), Hibiki 21($900), Hakushu 25 ($2500), Yoichi 15 ($1200), etc. are all phenomenal whiskies, but just on principal I cannot pay so much for the stuff on the secondary market, because it is completely disproportionately priced. That same money will get you very very far in Scotch land. Anyways, will this ever come back down to earth and normalize, or is this obscenity the new norm?",14,2020-07-09 14:15:17

Yippee Ki-Yay first hit the stand to commemorate Repeal Day on December 5th, 2015 after a successful run in our Barrel Select Program. Through this RnD program, we decided to play around with our High West Double Rye! and finished it in Syrah and vermouth wine barrels, thus Yippee Ki-Yay was born. It was a tough decision but due to a shift in focusing our portfolio, Yippee Ki-Yay has been discontinued. There were only 29,646 bottles ever produced so if you get the chance to snag one - be sure to rejoice in your good fortune. For many of us, this is a bittersweet farewell, but with every goodbye gives way to a new and exciting hello.

So a brief introduction: I‚Äôm not a whiskey drinker. I‚Äôve never been a fan of drinking whiskey, straight or on the rocks. I can tolerate some of the upper shelf Canadian whiskeys (crown xr etc.)... but that doesn‚Äôt help me with my current quest. 

What I do love are cocktails. I‚Äôve been mixing drinks for a couple years now and have acquired a good taste for about every liquor EXCEPT whiskey ... which leads me to my biggest dilemma, my favorite go-to cocktails have all been whiskey based! A Sazerac variant has been my all time favorite go-to, and for that reason I‚Äôve limited myself to buying Sazerac Rye. I want to branch out to try different whiskeys for my mixed drinks (think boulevardier, sazerac, Manhattan, etc.) but since I don‚Äôt enjoy whiskey straight - I can‚Äôt develop a good taste for it! 

So help me out! Things I know mix well: Sazerac Rye - things I HATED: Templeton Rye, Knob Creek Rye (though ironically the bourbon is good), Dickel

TLDR: I like whiskey cocktails, but no whiskey. Want to branch out from the Sazerac Rye but don‚Äôt have the taste to do so. Need guidance.",16,2020-06-06 14:10:35

by Big Dram Man

Label 5 blended Scotch is the 9th best selling Scotch brand in the world, with 31 million bottles sold globally.  Label 5 has a following in over 100 countries around the world but the majority is enjoyed in France, home of owner La Martiniquaise.


No age statement and bottled at 40%vol (80 proof) Label 5 Classic Black consists of grain blended with some Speyside Malts, including Glen Moray. It has also won several major awards in the whisky industry.

The nose: Cerals, honey, banana, apple, ginger, a hint of freshly cut grass and tyre rubber. fresh and bright but nothing special. 
Nose: 15/20

The palate: Astringent at first, soft smoke not found on the nose, banana, apple, barley sugar, burnt toast, toffee and a hint of lime.
Palate: 16/20

The finish: Short almost non existent, Barley sugar, apple and a touch of barrel spice and liquorice. Finish: 9/25

Price&amp;Branding: Priced at around ¬£15-¬£20 or around $20 in the US. The shape of the bottle is bad, feels like a mobile phone from the 80‚Äôs, and the label just screams cheap‚Ä¶. Good job it is! 
Price&amp;Branding: 10/25

Total: 50/100

Final thoughts: This is fine for a first time whiskey drinker as its non offensive and bright. It is so fresh and easy that it works on ice while reading a book in the sunshine on a hot day, but anyone who has some experience with scotch will taste and know that this is aimed at the mass market. I am sure it will have some followers but I‚Äôm not going out of my way to replace the bottle once it‚Äôs gone!

https://preview.redd.it/8zvm1b2iyj351.jpg?width=4545&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd6bb054d6aa7f29de5c614e77a53fbd47eea2fe

I have always enjoyed whiskey and have started really diving deep into whiskey for about a year now. After starting with different things from rye, to bourbon, to scotch, buying one bottle at a time, it took me about a full year to really be able to pick up notes that are recognizable enough to write a review so here it goes! (all feedback is appreciated on anything I could improve for the next post)

&amp;#x200B;

Color: Fairly light, in between a dark bourbon and lighter scotch

&amp;#x200B;

Nose: chocolate covered fruits, slightly rubbery, bright, walnuts, almost like a tootsie pop with the sugar fruit and somewhat fake chocolate

&amp;#x200B;

Pallet: much of the same with bright chocolate desert fruits, reminds me of an edible arrangement, slightly malty, very similar to the nose just much more intense; very good oily mouth feel

&amp;#x200B;

Finish: dry oak then finishes with a brightness and slight char at the same time, not peat smoke but a char or burnt taste similar to a porter, rounding out almost bitter like dark chocolate, and very long for ABV.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall: I chose to do this as my first whiskey review because it surprised me so much. I am usually a bourbon drinker and this is nothing like bourbon and I appreciate how it is unique and approachable. The mix of flavors is unique, and it really has great finish for a middle of the road ABV. It does feel a little disjointed and the char flavor or bitterness almost comes across as ashy cigar taste and does linger in a strange way for such a bright whiskey. I recommend keeping this in the home bar if you have a decent collection and it could be a daily drinker, but I see it more as an exploration whiskey to share with others.

Was looking for some advice/critique on bottle selection for an upcoming whiskey tasting I‚Äôm hosting.

The group is comprised of intermediate whiskey drinkers. No one experienced enough to really provide a full flavor profile, but definitely not wincing at the alchohol burn.

We planning on doing bourbon/scotch and maybe a misc bottle or 2.

Wanted to keep with staple top bottles that are mid ranged, nothing too fancy, just time tested pours that can help everyone discover what flavor profiles they enjoy most. 

For bourbons was going to go,

Eagle rare 
Four roses small batch
Makers mark 

For scotch 

Glenlivet 12
Macallan 12
Lagavulin 16

Then for misc.
High west campfire (to bridge the gap from bourbon to scotch)
Jamison (just you have a diff whiskey variety).

CarnivalTower,gyo9o8,1,whiskey,Whisky over politics,"With all the crazy stuff going on this year, gatherings with friends and family almost invariably end up with strong arguing over politics.

This can be a tough time for quiet/introvert people. We have our own point of view on what‚Äôs going on in the world, but we just don‚Äôt have a strong enough voice and attitude to change anyone‚Äôs opinion, and we only end up contributing to more political quarrel without really helping anything.

That is, until we put our whisky bottle on the table. We had kept it carefully hidden in our cooler, waiting for the perfect opportunity. And then, while our conservative friend is arguing with our liberal wife over some tedious subject, we drop the bomb: Four Roses Single Barrel, or Ardbeg 10, or Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban, or Lot 40 Rye Cask Strength, or whatever else we brought to this gathering. We simply put the bottle there, on the dinner table.

Suddenly, all faces change. Anger is replaced by curiosity. Your political affiliation doesn‚Äôt matter anymore: you become ‚Äúthe whisky guy‚Äù or ‚Äúthe whisky girl‚Äù. You become a good person in everyone‚Äôs eyes.

You pour a glass for everyone. Just like that, no one really wants to keep arguing - they realize that there is still *good* in this world, that not everything has to be related to politics. Republicans and democrats will look each other in the eyes with amazement over the peat, caramel, pear and vanilla that they taste. The aromas make them feel at peace with each other, and they start wondering why they were angry in the first place. From there, the rest of the night is much lighter, and everyone goes home happy. Everyone feels extremely lucky to have you in their life.

For you are now ‚Äúthe whisky person‚Äù, friend of all and enemy of none.",1,2020-06-08 08:23:48

Chainsmoker88,gyz59o,217,whiskey,"Did anyone else really like Islay/Islands Scotch right from the start, without having to ""develop a taste"" for them?","One thing you commonly hear is that peated Scotch is one you must develop a taste for, and not something ideal for beginners, unlike the light and sweet Highlands/Speyside whiskies. Of course there are exceptions, and taste is subjective, but generally that's what we tend to think.

Although I, and many others it seems, were introduced to peated malts as beginners and liked them. Some of the very first single malt Scotch I ever tried were Islays (Laphroaig and Lagavulin) as well as a few peated Highland malts such as Oban and Loch Lomond. And I loved them as much back then as I do. I didn't find the smokey flavour overpowering, challenging or offputting in the slightest. In fact, I much preferred the peated malts and I found Speysides to be.... well to put it bluntly, boring. Nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong, there are brilliant Speysides and I have nothing against the group as a whole. Glenmorangie, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Glen Grant, Tamnavulin, Monkey Shoulder... there's nothing wrong with them and I'd be happy to drink them all day, I just found them to be rather plain in comparison to an Islay like Lagavulin, or an Islands malt like Talisker, with much more complexity and a more interesting flavour. Now that I've been enjoying whiskey for the better part of a year now, I still feel exactly the same now as I did when I started.

Did anyone else feel this way? Were any of you introduced to peated Scotch as beginners and found it much more to your liking than common ""beginner's whiskey"", despite what we were led to believe?",136,2020-06-08 21:17:03

I'm in a bit of a pickle. I'm still fairly new to the love affair that we all share. I'm looking for a next bottle to try but there are just so many options. I was wondering if I listed a few favorites and a few I hate if Reddit could help with some recommendations. 

My favorites are:
Wigle Smoked Bourbon 
Glenlivet 18

Not a lot of commonality there I know. 

I cannot stand anything held in sherry casks.  I tried picking up a bottle of Monkey Shoulder based on YouTube reviews but am not a fan. 

I've been considering buying a few bottles of inexpensive whiskey but the thing I enjoy most is sharing something a little more off the beaten path/rare with friends.

t_junior,fwgd1w,1,whiskey,New Family Tradition,"Hey, all.

My 21st birthday is coming up this August. I've had this idea to start a new family tradition for my family. 

I've had the idea that on my 21st birthday, I will buy 2 identical bottles of whiskey. One for myself, and one for my first kid on their 21st birthday. This obviously has some significance to it, and I want to choose something that means a lot; I want it to be something I can share with my kid and reminisce about when I'm older.

I'm a big fan of Bourbons and Irish whiskeys. My first taste of whiskey was actually part of another family tradition when I was about 12 years old. My father is a master Hunter, and was once involved with the NWTF (National Wildlife Turkey Federation). Whenever you or someone you were with shot a turkey, you'd take a shot of Wild Turkey 101.

Sure enough, when I shot my first turkey at 12, I took my shot, and I abruptly ran for the sink to spit it out. I obviously love Wild Turkey as I've grown older, and it has a lot of sentimental value.

My question to you find men and women is this. If you were 21 and you could buy a bottle to give to your first kid on their 21st birthday, what would you buy them?

Hoping to hear some good stories and good discussion.

I have also found the Talisker 10 at 45.8% ABV with much less burn (if any) than the Glenmorangie.

My partner is a budding fan of whiskey and his birthday is coming up. I secretly purchased a bar cart he's been eyeing and feel that it would be best to present it to him along with a new bottle of whiskey (or two). Long and short, we live in Seattle and it's not in my best interest to go on a scavenger hunt for rare bottles at this time... However, I'd still like to get him *something* to go along with the cart. Bevmo, Total Wine, and Costco are still open for in-store shopping/curbside pick-up. Considering these are the places I will most likely shop at, are there any recommendations you can make? 

As for his preferences...  I'm honestly not sure. I know nothing about whiskey and fortunately for me, he has never asked me to partake in this interest with him. If it's helpful at all, some bottles he currently has on the kitchen counter are (I'll just write out what I see on the label):

* Nikka Whiskey From the Barrel
* Kavalan single malt
* Dalwhinnie Winter's Frost 
* Glenfiddich 15
* Glenfiddich 18
* Redbreast 12

He has a bunch of his finished bottles stored away in one of the high kitchen cupboards... I can't dig through it because we are both currently wfh and he will definitely hear the ruckus I make trying to climb up there. Hopefully, the few he has out is somewhat helpful in making some recommendations. He is not an avid purchaser so I think any decent recommendation will do. Honestly, anything helps...

Bourbinsane,fwsx06,1,whiskey,Larceny Barrel Proof A120 Review,"Larceny Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Batch A120

Posted on April 5, 2020

by¬†Chris Newell


The older and stronger brother of Heaven Hill‚Äôs latest wheated bourbon, Larceny is getting a jump in both proof and availability from years past. The A120 batch is the first of three annual releases from Heaven Hill for their barrel proof wheated bourbon. Following in the footsteps of¬†Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, new batches of Larceny Barrel Proof will be released in January, May, and September of each year. Each release will have a corresponding letter (A, B, or C) and number which represents the month and year of the release (Ex. A120 is January 2020, B520 is the May 2020 release, etc). Each release will differ in proof, with age remaining in the 6-8 year range.


Class:¬†Straight Bourbon Whiskey

Distillery:¬†Heaven Hill

Age:¬†NAS (Rumored six to eight year old bourbon)

Mashbill:¬†68% Corn, 20% Wheat, 12% Malted Barley

Proof:¬†123.2

MSRP:¬†~$50 (2020)

The Review:

Nose:

First dive into the glass emits an immediate punch of brown sugar, and rich, almost molasses- like syrup fills the nostrils. For being almost 125 proof, the alcohol punch and ethanol burn is more minimal than what I expected. A subtle mesh of orange peel and dark dried fruits come through next, followed by very light notes of oak and barrel tannins. Overall, this is a very sweet and pleasant nose, but nothing overly complex.¬†

Taste:

Immediately the ‚ÄúLarceny‚Äù wheated profile comes through for me on initial sip. Notes of fresh baked bread and cinnamon glide across the front and center of the palate. That classic Heaven Hill toasted caramel-drizzled almond note, shows up on the center of the tongue. This is drinking far smoother than the proof would suggest. The oak is more prevalent than on the nose, but the immense sweetness is the most dominant note from start to finish.¬†

Mouthfeel/Finish:

The mouthfeel is decent, but not near as coating or viscous as I would have hoped for, from a barrel proof expression. The flavors are consistent from start to finish, but it has a medium finish overall.¬†

Overall Impression:

If you are a fan of the base Larceny, you will not be disappointed in the A120 barrel proof offering, especially at $50. This is a very nice cask strength bourbon at an affordable price. I do feel there are superior expressions very near this price range, and I would have no problem jumping up to $60 to get an Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (ECBP) or Old Forester 1920 instead. Similar to the Elijah Craig Barrel Proof expressions for me personally, I am expecting bigger and better things from the next two releases of 2020. The C batches of ECBP have consistently been my favorite releases over the past few years, and I am curious to see if the Larceny Barrel Proof follows the same trend.

Maximum Price I Would Pay:¬†$62

BibleBourbonBonJovi,fx1ja4,1,whiskey,Condensation inside Bulleit bottle? First time it's happened,"So this is about the fourth bottle of Bulleit bourbon (the flagship expression) that I've bought and consumed, and once it got around halfway to two-thirds empty condensation formed on the inside of the bottle, especially up around the shoulders. I have never previously seen this with Bulleit or any other whiskey, and it hasn't happened to the other whiskeys that I have opened right now either. So is there something up with this particular bottle of Bulleit? Maybe its cork? Bulleit uses composite corks, so maybe this one's is a little faulty?

I've never taken it outside with me, so I don't think it's because of the outside humidity. And I keep it stored with all my other whiskeys between 65-75F, at normal indoor humidity levels.

So if anybody has experience with/knowledge of this anomaly...please advise.",1,2020-04-08 14:50:50

* Bulleit Bourbon

* Teeling Trinity Pack (Enjoyed them all, but probably wouldn't buy them again)

Disliked:

* Black Bull 10 years

I am looking for an expert advise. My boyfriend's birthday is just around the corner and I want to surprise him with some delicious whiskey, however I have about zero knowledge about whiskeys. Therefore I would greatly appreciate every piece of advice and suggestions I can get. 

He's no seasoned whiskey drinker, as far as I know his favorite is the classic Jack Daniel's Old no. 7. I was thinking about purchasing the Single Barrel Select, however I would rather astonish him with something different, something new for him and maybe a bit more mature. But this is where I am at lost and desperately need some guidance. He loves everything with the taste of vanilla and everything spicy. So I am thinking something sweeter but not too much, with fruity and vanilla flavors and hint of spiciness as well as something suitable for pleasant introduction into the world of proper whiskeys. 

What caught my interest so far are Four Roses Single Barrel/Small Batch,  Woodford Reserve Distiller Select, Bulleit Bourbon 10 y, Glenfiddich 12 y or Jack Daniel's Getleman Jack, would any of these perhaps be a good choice? I can't afford anything too expensive, up to 50 dollars, but preferably less and as I said something that would make a great birthday present. 

Thanks for all the advice!",17,2020-03-08 22:20:54

Chainsmoker88,ffyidw,1,whiskey,I mostly drink Scotch and Irish whiskey and am looking to get into bourbon. Where do I start?,"Basically the title. Almost all whiskey I drink at the moment is either Irish or Scotch. There's no style in particular that I prefer. I'm open to and enjoy all types from all regions. Single pot still, single malt, blended, triple distilled, double distilled, Highlands, Speyside, Islay, Lowlands, etc. My favourite Irish whiskey as of now is Redbreast 12 cask strength and my favourite Scotch would be either Lagavulin or Auchentoshan.

Although I don't drink a lot of bourbon. I've tried the basics, like WT101 (which I was honestly a bit disappointed with), OGDBIB (which I liked), and Maker's Mark, which I also liked. I want to expand a bit more into the world of bourbon. I see a lot of people on this sub recommending Buffalo Trace (which I also enjoy), but is unfortunately very overpriced where I live. I can't get a 700ml bottle for any less than about ‚Ç¨40. Ridiculous, I know. Can anyone recommend me a solid, affordable bourbon that isn't Makers?",14,2020-03-10 01:43:57

Quite simplified, sure, but I can still taste the character of the whiskey through it, and IMO it‚Äôs pretty darn good.

For the whiskey, I‚Äôve usually gone Monkey Shoulder, and that‚Äôs been good, but today I made a half recipe with Ardbeg An Oa. I know that sounds crazy, a good scotch in a toddy, but it was actually really good. The smoke shone through, and I found a note I can‚Äôt put my finger on that I hadn‚Äôt tasted in the An Oa before.

We have an open bottle of Van Brunt Stillhouse Whiskey that we keep on a shelf (which, might I add, is an excellent whiskey). Rather than using the cork stopper that comes with the bottle, my boss was using this metal stopper to keep the bottle closed. We just use it because it looks nice. We noticed the other day that there is some white stuff on the stopper. I wasn't able to find any info as to what this white stuff could be online. I feel like it might be some type of mold, but it seems weird that it's on a metal stopper (a cork stopper would make more sense to me). It also seems odd because it's alcohol and I would think it can't grow mold? But what do I know.

**About the Spirit**

Booker‚Äôs Shiny Barrel Batch is the second batch of 2019, and its name was taken from a tradition that took place in years past when rackhouse employees would sneak tastes of bourbon out from selected barrels. In doing so, it would cause the dust to be removed from these barrels when their bellies would rub up against them. These now shiny barrels from the center of the rackhouse would be where the good stuff was located, making it easy for Booker Noe to select what to bottle for his namesake bourbon. This batch has the lowest abv of all the Booker‚Äôs bourbons.

**ABV:** 62%, 124 Proof

**Mash-bill:** 77% corn, 13% rye, 10% malted barley

**Batch#:** 2019-02 ‚ÄúShiny Barrel Batch‚Äù

Barrels came from:

18% from the 6th floor of 9-story warehouse D

39% from the 4th floor of 9-story warehouse E

43% from the 4th floor of 9-story warehouse J

**About the Distillery**

Booker‚Äôs brand bourbon is a small batch bourbon brand that is apart of the Jim Beam distillery, which is owned by Beam-Suntory (a subsidiary of Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Ltd, a sub-subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Japan), the third largest producer of distilled spirits in the world. James Beam begin putting barrels for purchase out in 1795, and by 1935 the James B. Distilling Company was established. In 1945 it was bought and then re-sold in 1968 to American Brands Inc. Then in 1987, the company purchased National Distillers and renamed itself the Jim Beam Brands Company. After a few years of trades and purchasing, Suntory purchased Jim Beam for roughly $16 billion dollars. Beam-Suntory was established in 2014 after the purchase and resulted in some surprise when Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Ltd suggested the whiskey could be better by using the Japanese way of business, ‚Äúkaizen‚Äù.

Booker‚Äôs brand in particular, was named for Jim Beam‚Äôs distiller emeritus (and grandson), Booker Noe, who hand selected the barrels to be used in future Booker‚Äôs batches. Originally, the bourbon was taken straight out of the barrels by Noe and given to family and friends as gifts, but eventually made for public purchase in the late 1980s. The selected barrels are aged in the middle of the rackhouse to become ‚Äúfine bourbon‚Äù. The bourbon is sold unfiltered and uncut at cask strength between 121 and 130.6 proof, aged between six and eight years (except for the anniversary and rye editions). Bottles typically have a price range of $50-110 USD (except for special releases), location depending. After Booker Noe‚Äôs passing, Fred Noe, now Jim Beam‚Äôs Master Distiller, leads Booker‚Äôs production. 

**Price Paid Minnesota USA:**

$65.99

**Evaluation**

Glass: 6oz rocks glass

Appearance: Deep amber/Chestnut

Nose: slight fruit, vanilla/ maple, dissipating ethanol, Christmas, wood and leather

Taste: Thick and oily, so much savory flavor that steak and potatoes was my first thought (so weird). Spice, ethanol, anise or nutmeg, hot and med-long tingly finish with peanut on the mid to back palate. Drinks lower than the proof, for sure. 

With water added, I got strong apple pie and nutmeg, but overall without water was better for me.

Mouthfeel: Thick and oily

Finish: Medium tingling warm finish with peanut

  Value considered\*

  **My Rating:**

9-Like Extremely

Well, this is the most expensive bottle of whiskey I have and not surprisingly, my favorite right now. What was surprising is how much I did not care for it when I first opened it up, but after a month, the acetone taste went away, and the flavors of this bourbon are quite a treat. It was way easy to sip at 124 proof. I am still on the lookout for ‚Äúsip a while‚Äù, but for now I am pretty happy with this Booker‚Äôs batch. I have not had other Booker‚Äôs, so this line is always one that I‚Äôd like to have a bottle of in my cabinet. 

**Re-Purchase**

Yes! At $65, yes. If at $80, no.",4,2020-02-08 00:20:55

I would like to know what's the best practice regarding the making of your mash for whiskey (corn, barley, wheat, etc) and adding sugar to increase the overall alcohol efficiency.

The sugar levels you reach from boiling the ingredients are usually not that high... Don't get me wrong, I'm quite aware that you can't exaggerate or you'll end up screwing over the complete mash. But is it allowed in terms of whiskey making? Would you still be allowed to call your spirit whiskey afterward? Do you have to write this information on the label?

I'm somewhat aware that this is not a popular topic or rather a sensitive question, but I would still like to discuss this in the mature matter.

He hasn't really gotten into whiskey, but we discussed it and agreed that it's something that should be a fun time for him. 

The rest of us are a group of guys with varying levels of appreciation of whiskey and spirits, but I think everyone is a bit older (not 20 lol) and can appreciate a good whiskey, I've personally been actively investing in good spirits for a half year and have had some Yamazaki, my fiance and I went to Japan last year and visited the Yamazaki Distillery (It was awesome, I'd definitely recommend a visit.), i'm keen on making this a good time, but had I more foresight back then I should have bought stuff. 

If it works, I'd like to track down a bottle of Yamzaki, and perhaps a Nikka for a bit of an introduction to good Japanese Whiskey, and I also need to figure out where to go and get this stuff in Southern California, where I am based. Yamazaki 12 sounds like a great thing, but I honestly don't know if I'd be spending money on it for the hype or the appreciation with this group....

I've noticed that in this sub, it seems like 95% of the time people are either posting bourbon or scotch, but I don't see much of Irish whiskey. I guess the questions I'm getting at are:

* Where's a good starting place to get into Irish whiskey? It's been so long since I've even had Jameson that I'd like to give it a shot.
* What exactly sets Irish whiskey apart from scotch/bourbon/etc.?
* Is there a reason Irish whiskey doesn't seem to get a whole lot of love in this sub compared to its American and Scottish counterparts?

matthewrobertk,emddjb,1,whiskey,looking for scotch and rye advice,"Hey Guys,

Im pretty new to good high quality whiskey. I've always been more of a craft beer drinker than a spirits guy. Whiskey has always been my go to if I'm going to drink hard liquor though. My two go to bottles have always been Jameson and Bulleit rye.

I've recently decided to start getting into some more high quality, higher level whiskeys. My first purchase was a bottle of Red Breast 12 and it was a game changer, i didn't know whiskeys could carry such flavor.

I'm looking for suggestions on both a bottle of scotch and a bottle of rye that are about the equivalent level of the Red Breast 12. Preferably i would like to stay under about $75 per bottle. If i can spend less thats even better.

A bit about my taste preferences. I tend to enjoy strong, full flavored things more. I drink dark roast coffee black, I like full flavored full strength cigars, I love high percentage cocoa dark chocolate and i the higher IBU i can get in my beer the better. I also love the spice Rye gives things, i love beer made from Rye. I don't necessarily want this to translate to high proof spirits, though im not opposed, but i would rather stay away from smooth and mellow suggestions.  Im looking for something thats going to show up on my taste buds. For the scotch i would love something smokey and maybe even peated.

As a little twist and so im not overwhelmed with options, you can only suggest one bottle of each. if you only had one bottle, what would it be?

Lastly, i am in the Portland area and there are a lot of local distilleries around here, most make whiskeys. If you're in the area and familiar what are the ones really worth checking out?

thanks everyone! cheers!",7,2020-01-10 02:03:40

I heard a lot about Scotch Whiskey though, so I bought a Highland Park.

 That stuff tasted like someone accidentally threw a roasted pig into a barrel of vodka, and only discovered it 10 days later, noticed it looked like Whiskey and sold that stuff to me. I could literally put bacon-juice into a 4 dollar vodka bottle and it'd taste the same to me. I googled it, and it said it had ""high smokiness"". I tried making a whiskey sour, literally putting a whole lemon into my glass, a whole egg, water, and sugar. And all I could taste was creamy bacon-juice.

Is this something new? I googled it, and nobody seemed to be so disgusting by this drink as I am. Can someone explain what could've happened to my bottle?",14,2020-01-11 01:01:58

Brotisimo,e8irfv,1,whiskey,What is your dream dram and why?,"As the title states, do you have a particular whiskey or two that stands out as a pinnacle if you had the opportunity to own or try it? 

It could be cheap or expensive, popular or rare. Maybe it has a nostalgic place in your heart or perhaps represents an elusive bottle you've always hoped to find.  Maybe you've even been lucky enough to already achieve your dream dram!

Personally, I find myself returning back to the same few themes when I day dream about those I would like to enjoy:

I lust after the beautiful bottles of Samaroli. I'm a sucker for independent bottlings and for great design. Samaroli had (has) a way of using their labels to transport you somewhere. I appreciate the classic nature of their marketing and their high quality contents.

Dead distilleries are the second category I can't seem to get away from. No matter the region or the age, my eyes widen and my heart flutters for a Caperdonich or a Rosebank. I am slowly collecting some that I look forward to enjoying for many years to come, knowing they'll be more difficult to find in the future.

One pour represents my holy grail and it may seem a bit silly:

It was bottled the year I was born at a perfectly round 50 years of age. It's from an era I never imagined being able to transport all the way back to: 1939. I hope to acquire a bottle in the next few months via auction so I can toast to the birth of my incoming firstbornS! I know the seal will be shot and the pour may be cooked from 30 years of UV light, but what it represents to me is a past to go along with myself, the present, and my children, the future. A small toast to another step in my own journey.

Apologies for the long post, and thanks to those who read all the way through.

I would love to hear your grail whiskies!",14,2019-12-10 08:28:47

alick_g,e8s11m,1,whiskey,Whisk(e)y Tasting,"Hi All,

I'm organizing a whiskey tasting with a few of my friends and finally have an official line up - having purchased the last bottle (Green Spot) yesterday per you folk's recommendations.  Anyway, below is a list of the bottles we will be trying (in a tentative order).  Of course I want to start with the lightest whiskies first, and end with the more powerful whiskies last, but I also wanted to keep the spirits group by country of origin.  Let me know what you think of the order and if you folks think anything should be shuffled around.  I by no means claim to be good at this and I appreciate any comments and suggestions.

1. Buffalo Trace
   1. I wanted to start off with a bourbon that we all have tasted before, so that the people who aren't used to describing what they smell and taste can start with something familiar and relatively non-complex 
2. Four Roses Single Barrel
3. Woodford Rye
4. Green Spot 
5. Auchentoshan American Oak
6. Glen Scotia Double Cask
7. Macallan 12 Sherry Oak
8. Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask
9. Oban 14
10. Highland Park 12 Viking Honour
11.  Laphroaig 12
   1. I don't think any of my guests will enjoy this, I personally struggled with this bottle for about a year before I began to enjoy it.  I'm just hoping my guests will gain an appreciation and understanding of Scotches like this.

Thank you!",20,2019-12-10 23:29:15

thomasredden,e8veij,1,whiskey,Enough with clearing shelves of bourbon if you haven't even tried it.,"You are taking bottles away from people who know they will enjoy them, why can't this be a community instead of a cutthroat economy veering more towards clearing shelves of bottles so you can make a buck. There's a million side hustles you can choose, why must you choose to invade a community of connoisseurs and hobbyists. We love the experience of whiskey and want as many experiences as we can have, but when shitty people clear the shelves of a whiskey solely bc they want to make a buck, your a shit person and your killing a host of experiences for people who would actually enjoy them, not just see them as a dollar sign. Do you I guess, I cant make anyone stop, but this is a massively growing problem that's resulting in things like buffalo trace being twice what it retails at, Henry McKenna being at least $20 more then it used to (I know I know awards) only bc everytime anyone sees them they take all they can carry and sit on them till they find someone who's desperate enough to pay it. If you stumble across a whiskey you truly enjoy and you don't set often, I don't have an issue with grabbing a back up bottle or two as long as they are resulting in made memories and lovely experiences with friends and family. Whiskey is something that brings people together and is conducive to the making of special nights and bringing people together. Bottle flippers are commercializing the community that's so dear to me and making selections across the country thinner and thinner simply for the sake of lining ones pockets. It's getting really old and I know this won't change a damn thing, but i just wish stores would be forced to set prices based on an MSRP decided by the distillers and create bottle limits based on rarity. It would give way more people an opportunity to experience ALL that whiskey has to offer, not just what they can find in the sparse whiskey section of there liquor stores. And this is coming from someone who really has no trouble getting mostly everything I want, however I dont think it's right others never get to have more than the narrow experiences of the mass produced always stocked whiskeys like JD#7 or Jim Beam.",43,2019-12-11 03:32:25

What are your thoughts? Do you drink MGP? Do you avoid their products? Do you think what they do is valuable for the industry?

I tried that with the Caol Islay but I just didn't like the aftertaste. Caol Islay and Aberlour have a similar aftertaste that for whatever reason that I experience, others probably don't that I don't enjoy.

Bulleit Bourbon was much much harsher to drink. Had a base of pine tree or something, might be the alcohol? Idk 

Both were generally really sweet and good. Similar tasting tho if I tried them weeks apart maybe. My palate for this is really clumsy apparently.

I do know their taste is very wide ranging, from lots of Japanese whiskey (nikka coffey and suntory harmony were two I recall them mentioning), as well as kavalan, but they also just came back from Kentucky and did a distillery run and want to go back they enjoyed it so much so I'm not sure they're exclusively on the Asian branded bottles.

I know that's not super helpful! I would ask them for more information but I do want to keep this a surprise.

Also, not related but what the hell is up with pappy van winkle? The msrps and what I see them going for are insanely out of whack.

Last week I was flying back to Canada and picked up a 1L bottle from the duty free in Frankfurt, extremely excited to drink it once Im back. BOY what a disappointment! Literally tastes like a completely different whiskey. This one smells like malt cereal with maybe a touch of honey. Nowhere near as smooth as I remember, and tastes straight up flat and boring. I thought it was just me, so I asked my dad if he thought the same thing, and he completely agreed that it tasted like a different whiskey. He said went as far as to check the batch number on the bottle (and as we later found out it's not a real batch number, but an homage to the original batch size).

Im looking for a whiskey, for a complete begginner in this subject. After a short reaserch what i ended up with are:  
 

CRAIGELLACHIE 13YO WHISKY 0,7L 46%                        

 GLENFIDDICH IPA WHISKY 0,7L 43%              (this one seems really interesting)

 GLENFIDDICH XX WHISKY 0,7L 47%                        

 CHIVAS REGAL RED NIGHT MAGNUM 12YO WHISKY 1,5L 40%             


  
Any thoughts? Im open for any new ideas, i don't know if they are something worth my money. Im really open for new ideas, also i never really encountered thing in my life that i didn't like. Theese four seem okay, im especially intrigued by **Glenfiddich IPA**, and **Chivas Regal**. Chivas seems interesting becuase it's been aged for quite a while but the price is... low, suprisingly low. And i couldn't find any source really ever mentioning it.  And **Glenfiddich IPA**, because it's a single malt scotch whisky, matured in a fruity, citrusy beer berrel, which can (for my reasoning) be something really good, or either really bad.

This was first sip of any Weller and I have to say I liked it.  I was nervous because my other recent wheated bourbon was larceny, and I thought it was absolutely horrible (couldn't get past the grass taste).  Unlike the larceny, I didn't get any of the earthiness on the Weller.  In fact, it was so easy to drink, I was able to get the vanilla and caramel to be expected from most Bourbons.  There was quite a bit of ethanol in the finish, but overall, a good drink if it's at a reasonable price.

My second drink tonight was High West - Yipee-ka-yay!  This was my first ever rye, and I really liked it.  Now I understand what people mean when they say it tastes like...rye.  In fact, if this is representative of ryes in general, I'd have to say they are the spirit that tastes most like the grain they are distilled from.  That said, I really didn't get anything besides the rye.  Really just tasted like I was having rye bread.

My question to you seasoned pros is---is this rye representative of a typical rye?  Is it similar to the midwinter nights dram?  Pikesville?  Excited to try another, but can't wait until then to find out for myself.",4,2019-11-12 13:41:23

WoodstockWhiskey,dhh3ao,10,whiskey,Review: High West's A Midwinter Nights Dram Act 7 Scene 1,"Fall is here in Georgia finally.  Those 90 degree days are gone and we‚Äôre met with mild temperatures and cool breezes.  Today in particular was just a rainy, cool,  lazy Sunday and I had a craving for a pour of something that matched the weather and my mood.  What better drink to start off Autumn with than High West‚Äôs A Midwinter Nights Dram?

This is one of my favorite fall/winter pours and is a perfect whiskey for sitting outside in the cool weather and just taking in a bit of nature as you sip away on this pleasant rye blend.  MWND is one of High West‚Äôs special releases each year and is a blend of their Rendezvous Rye whiskey that has been finished in French Oak port barrels.  The Act denotes the year of production and the Scene denotes the bottling batch (i.e. Act 7 is the 7th year they‚Äôve produced MWND and Scene 1 is the first batch produced this year).

Unlike Basil Hayden‚Äôs Dark Rye, this is how rye finished in port should be done.  The whiskey first and foremost both smells and tastes like rye and then you get a bit of the port barrel influence that adds a fruity sweetness to an already pleasant rye.  The nose is rich with rye spice, dried fruits from the port barrel and Christmas spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.  The palate is sweet with vanilla, caramel and rye spices.  There are hints of cinnamon and dark fruits as well, followed by a long and warm finish with the rye spice and cinnamon sweetness lingering on the tongue.

img_1743

Doing a quick taste test comparing the bottle to last year‚Äôs release, Act 7 squeaks out ahead of last year‚Äôs ever so slightly.  There‚Äôs a deeper richness to this year‚Äôs release and I‚Äôm not sure if that can be attributed to oxidization of my Act 6 since it‚Äôs been open a year or if there really is more flavor in this years release.  The basic flavor profile is on point with both pours, but Act 7 is just a tiny bit sweeter and richer.  I‚Äôd still take a bottle of either if offered, so take that for what you will.

MWND is a very well balanced rye that pairs well with crisp, cool weather and cloudy days.  I would highly recommend this bottle to anyone that wants a unique rye experience or just wants to try something different.  This could be a gateway whiskey for the wine fan in your life as it‚Äôs rather accessible at 98.6 proof and could be brought a bit lower with a few drops of water and still remain faithful to its flavor profile.  MSRP on this bottle is $99 here in Georgia and I think while that‚Äôs a bit steep, it‚Äôs a fair price for this delicious bottle.  I had to call several stores to get one for $99, with many charging as much as $149 for the handful of bottles they received, which I personally don‚Äôt think is worth the 50% markup.  However, it seemed much easier to find this year, so I don‚Äôt know if production went up or if allocation in Georgia went up.  Either way, I like that I was able to find one with relative ease this year even a week or two after they hit the state distribution.  If you can find one for close to retail, I would recommend giving it a try.  I don‚Äôt think you will be disappointed.

sunz3000,dhxtls,1,whiskey,My Trip to Hakushu Distillery,"I traveled to Japan earlier this year and visited a few distilleries. I haven't had a chance to type this up and format it correctly, but I did get some time to do it now. This is my review/experience when visiting the distilleries. I have also reviewed some of the whiskies that I have tasted while visiting the distilleries.

For my distillery trips:

* To and from Hakashu from Tokyo
* To \[Kirin\] from Tokyo, then headed to Kyoto
* To \[Yamazaki\] from Kyoto, then headed to Osaka

You can find the reviews of all the whiskies I tried [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/dhldes/whiskey_reviews_114_japan_trip/).

&amp;#x200B;

My journey begins in Tokyo and luckily, I can take the train from Tokyo to the distillery. Before heading to Japan, I did a search on [HyperDia](http://www.hyperdia.com/) for the prices of the ticket and the train line (this is important) and how to get there. I also had a JR Pass, so I need to keep an eye on the train line to make sure that I get a reserved seat (for both getting there and back).

I arrived at Shinjuku station and was a bit lost. The signs have a bit of English, but I needed to make sure the time was precise. I ended up asking one of the platform agents and he showed me where to stand. The total travel time of the journey is 2 hrs.

Once boarded, seated, and the train started moving, I took a look outside the window (I like to see landscapes outside the city). The countryside is amazing to see - a great view of many farms (rice, and some grapes for Japanese wines). I also had the opportunity to go towards the end of Sakura blossoms so I was able to see quite a number of trees with the flowers. Mount Kita was fairly easy to see but on my journey it was a bit cloudy, making Mount Fuji a bit of a challenge.

Once I arrived at Kobuchizawa station, I realized that I didn't schedule it out well enough to grab the free shuttle bus to the distillery. I ended up paying  ¬•2,080 for the taxi ride to the distillery. Not too bad but better planning could have avoided spending an extra \~$20 CAD.

When I arrived at the distillery and went up to the counter; there wasn't a line so I was able to get my pass for the distillery tour quickly. Note that it's cash only for the entrance fee. If you're going in a group, the distillery staff will colour code your badge: green - can drink alcohol, pink - designated driver, yellow - under 20 years old.

Once I got in, I walked around the grounds for a little while before heading to the museum. There was quite a bit of information on the history of Hakushu but also the efforts they have made to ensure the wildlife is preserved. It took about 30 min to get through the museum.

About 5 min before my tour, I requested for an English audio guide. I didn't realize you could grab an app and listen to it on your phone. I didn't have my headphones with me which would have made listening to the guide easier. The tour guides did give me a loaner phone with the app but this was a bit clumsy - taking pictures, reading and listening can be cumbersome (seriously - the headphones would be really helpful). If I had to do it again I'd grab the app and use my headphones to listen without needing to hold up the guide to my head.

Anyway, once I got the audio guide, there's a test feature so I quickly did a test and got a sense of the audio guide. Once set up, we headed to the tasting room from the museum to get a brief orientation. The orientation includes a taste of the fresh mountain water, a video (subtitled) and a PowerPoint guide in English (which you'll read the first 3 pages for since the rest is for the tasting). You don't need to listen to anything on the guide (only when prompted by the guide). What I found useful was the numbers on the wall. If you see them, turn on the audio guide immediately and you'll keep good pace with the group especially since the the tour is in Japanese. I will admit the fumbling with the audio guide and camera was a pain.

You can take as many pictures as you want but make sure you keep up with the group. You'll first head to the mashing building and learn about the ingredients and the distillation process. While I was listening to the audio guide, I can tell that the Hakushu distillery cares quite a bit about the water source and the environment. They also go through the details of the other ingredients, mainly the barley and peat used (there's some peat around to touch and smell).

One interesting thing is the mash tun is the typical metal one, but the fermentation tun is made of wood. I was surprised by this but they justified it by noting it was easier to control the temperature with it (I may have missed the exact quote from the audio guide).

We moved on to the distillation area but unfortunately they do not allow you in. I was behind a glass wall so it was more of a see it and watch this video thing.

Next step in the tour: maturation - which was a bit away and they shuttle you in a bus. At this point there is some optional listening on the audio guide which again talks about the wildlife around the distillery. Again, if the guide prompts you first or you see the number just start the audio.

Once I was shuttled to the warehouse, I got an introduction to the casks and a few example ones and then walk into the storage room. Upon first steps in, I could tell it was massive. It would be an understatement to say I was barely able to see the back walls. It seems like Hakushu has adopted the American bourbon style of storing whiskey since they noted that where a barrel is stored affects the aging.

Once we was done looking at the warehouse, we were shuttled back to the tasting room and finally taste something other than mountain water. By the time I got back to the tasting room, there weren't any modules in the audio guide so I handed it back to one of the guides at the tasting room. In the tasting room, everything will be set up: 4 tasting glasses and a fifth glass with 30ml of Hakushu NAS for the highball.

I was told to follow along to the slides and the guide on the tasting procedure that the master distiller does. The tastings include the 3 general whiskies that make up the Hakushu 12. The slides include everything about the notes. Once you get to the 4th glass with the blend, I had some information on the pairings for the whiskey.

Finally, the 5th glass: the guide walked through creating a high ball the proper way (i.e. Hakushu way). Because the highball is a bit more in alcohol, they provided various foods that can be paired with it. During this time I took my time eating and drinking and filling out the feedback form.

Once I was done, the guides offered some discounts at specific stores, but I was told they were far. Besides it was in Japanese and I don't think I'd get too far with them. If you were traveling Japan by car, I'd recommend finding out more about the discounts.

At the end, the group will thank the guide and everyone heads on their own way. Generally though, everyone heads to the shop.

At the shop, I was able to purchase a variety of souvenirs and some whiskey. I decided to grab something I couldn't get in Canada - one of the early blends Hakushu made. I did a quick Reddit search and picked the one that seemed good. Note that you can use credit cards in the gift shop.

Near the gift shop is the tasting bar. I didn't get a chance to use it but when I took a brief look at the menu, nothing seemed to jump out as special (you can generally get these in Tokyo bars). I had to leave to catch the shuttle bus to the train station so the tasting room and the restaurant were out of the question.

Heading back, I reflected on the experience and wrote up some of my brief points on the tour. I will note that I didn't get a proper lunch (literally the only food I had was the food given at the tasting) and should have grabbed something from 7/11 or Family Mart.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of buying alcohol, I'd recommend buying from a grocery store. There's more selection available and ones that are better rated on r/worldwhiskey than available at the distillery store.",11,2019-10-15 05:56:39

I am just getting into this hobby. I literally have very little information.  I do like whiskey and I also like spending on some of the finer things in life.  I am trying to build a whiskey collection that is representative of different regions. 

So far things that I have liked are Lagavulin 16  and Johnie Walker Blue.   I know these are super cliche. I want things around the 100 price range unless its a must then im willing to go higher.  I want to have around 5-10 bottles.  I am particularly clueless about the Japanese bottles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions?",4,2019-10-15 10:46:02

arbeck,d2t1dz,5,whiskey,What to try next,"I'm not exactly new to whiskey as I've been a Bourbon drinker for years, but have mainly been drinking rums for the last few years. I've decided to start expanding my palate of whiskey over the last few months.

I generally enjoy higher rye bourbons (Old Grand Dad 114, Four Roses SB, WT 101), though I'm not a big fan of Rye straight on it's own (save the new Old Forester Rye). I will occasionally have a wheated bourbon, but am not a huge Maker's fan, and Weller has become nearly impossible for me to get. Other than all of the craft brands out there, I've probably had most of the major releases that are at least semi-widely available.

As for rum, I really enjoy non additive rum. Anything from Barbados and St. Lucia Pot/Column blends, Jamaican Pot Still, and Agricole.

I also enjoy stuff from craft distilleries if they are doing something interesting and not just trying to copy Scotch or Bourbon (Ironroot Republics Corn Bourbon and Highwire Distilling's Single varietal Bourbon and Rye for example). Even when I don't love the flavor, I find it's an interesting educational experience.

I've been branching out in whiskey and have recently tried and enjoyed The Irishman Founders Reserve (Rum Cask Finish), Balvenie Caribbean Cask Finish, the entire lineup of non peated Westland, and Redbreast 12. Basically I've been trying to drink more malt whiskey and especially Scotch and Irish.

I don't care for any peated or smokey scotch I've ever had. At best they remind me of the creosote you get from flawed BBQ, and at worst an ashtray filled with used bandaids. I've had the Macallan 12 and thought it was just fine. And I've never had a Japanese whiskey that I thought was worth what I paid for it.

Some of the things I'm considering at the moment are: Teeling Small Batch, Redbreast 12 cask strength (though I'd be watering this back to about 50% ABV), and Aberlour 12. I don't like to spend much more than $50/bottle on something unless I'm really certain I'm going to like it. Any suggestions on other things to add to the list? It doesn't help that I'm in Washington State, and we don't always have the best options available and our prices are astronomical.",6,2019-09-12 00:42:23

So when I went in for a re-up I noticed there was a 12Y Sherry Cask for $20 more. Figured well I liked the 10 I bet this is going to be phenomenal.

Different ryes are incredibly polarizing to me, to an extent I don‚Äôt even feel for vastly different scotches. I‚Äôve heard rave reviews about rye whiskeys like Rendezvous Rye and Masterson‚Äôs 10 Year - I found them practically undrinkable, like drinking pickle juice (for the former) and sour pickled leather (for the latter). Yet, I love Whistlepig, RR Rye, and (especially) EHT Rye. 

The trouble is, when considering something new, I feel like it‚Äôs going to be a coin flip when it comes to rye. This usually means I unfortunately stay away from rye entirely. Has anyone else experienced this, and have you figured out what distinguishes the good from the bad? I thought it might be the legendary MGP dill at work, but the Masterson‚Äôs is sourced elsewhere, so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on here. Maybe good whiskey is just in the rye of the beholder.",9,2019-09-15 01:58:46

This is so hard.

Unfortunately I have not had a chance to try top tier Bourbon. The best ones I've had is Bookers, Makers Cask, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, and Jack Daniels SBBP. 

My choices:

1. Springbank 15 - Scotch. Very complex. Funk, Peat, Dried fruit, salt, chocolate. 

2. Glendronach 18 - Scotch Sherry bomb.

3. Arran 18 - Scotch Tropical Fruit bomb.

Just missed the cut:

1. Red Breast Cask Strength. Love this stuff. 

2. Ardbeg Uigeadail. My favorite peat monster.

I‚Äôm a university student living in a fairly dense urban area. I got my license back in my hometown where you need a car, but here, I rely heavily on walking, public transit, and Lyft if necessary. So I don‚Äôt have a car. 

If I buy a bottle at the grocery store, I walk home with it, and if I go to my local Total Wine, I walk over to the bus stop and head home from there. The main question here though: is it risky to carry home a bottle or whiskey in 110F weather? The last bottle I bought was Highland Park 12, but that was back in June when the weather wasn‚Äôt quite as bad. Luckily, the bus didn‚Äôt take long to show, and as far as my novice tongue could tell, it tasted quite good. But now that it‚Äôs hotter, would it still be okay? How much heat can they take? And for how long? Need I be concerned in the first place? If there is some kind of damage caused by the exposure to heat, I should probably think about taking a Lyft back.",3,2019-07-15 06:18:45

He said he'd prefer to try smoky as opposed to sweet and that anything cinnamon was out (As if Fireball was a contender...)

So far I'm bringing a few old bottles of my own:

- Woodford Reserve Bourbon
- Lismore Speyside Single Malt
- Kirkland Signature Blended Scotch (Really more for the quantity than the quality and my friend had it)
- Lagavulin 16 (Massive jump up from the others I know, but typically when I get something for myself I go for the quality. Lagavulin is my absolute favorite I've tried)

So far I'm considering buying:

- Wild Turkey (Something easy and apparently not too far from Jack Daniels)
- Old Grand Dad Bonded 
- George Dickel (Leaning away from this as I've heard of the mineral taste and divisiveness regarding its flavors in general)
- Bulleit (Either bourbon or rye. I'm more interested in the rye myself but perhaps that will stray too far into the spicy category for him.)
- Woodinville Bourbon (Local to our area but pricier)
- Basil Hayden
- Four Roses

I'm open to any help on this list or any other specific suggestions. Ultimately I'm trying to find him something to ease into the larger world of whiskey but that isn't too far from Jack Daniels, and then something slightly different to see if he likes other types such as ryes or even Canadian whiskeys.",8,2019-07-16 12:23:00
JayVeeBee,cduca3,0,whiskey,Missed it by that much...,"I like to frequent thrift stores and estate sales in my free time. The thrill of the hunt for the next thing I really don‚Äôt need is awesome. 

Legit businesses like Goodwill, and even established estate sale companies, can‚Äôt sell alcohol for many reasons. The closest I ever found was half a bottle of triple sec in a dusty corner of a basement ‚Äúbar‚Äù at an estate sale in the middle of nowhere. 

Church rummage sales kind of blur that business line though. They always sell things dirt cheap, and everything is donated by people in hopes of helping the church, so you never know what will show up. The little old ladies that always volunteer to run things often don‚Äôt realize or don‚Äôt care about laws/rules like that. 

I walked into a church sale this past weekend just after it opened and headed for the ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù room, where collectibles and other expensive items go that the organizers want to keep a close eye on. And there it was... The unmistakable Jack Daniels logo. A bottle sized wooden box on the top of a shelf. I pull it down to get a closer look and see if it‚Äôs worth adding to my collection of JD stuff. Crisp bottle label, hang tag attached, cork stopper included... I‚Äôd never heard of Barrelhouse 1 before, so I pull out my phone to do some quick googling. 

The lady watching the room looks over at me and chuckles, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs empty, we had to pour it out when we set up this morning.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I realized they had just dumped out a $1000 bottle of whiskey. 

I ended up buying the box and bottle because it looks cool. But I poured one out for the bottle that got poured out when I got home.",2,2019-07-16 16:33:09

Wonda,bzypwv,2,whiskey,What's next?,"After getting into bourbon last year and taking a break I've been jumping back into things with a more ""scientific"" approach - or at least that's what I tell myself and how I justify dropping all this cash.

I've been reading the recommendation pages and attempting to try a little bit of everything to see what I like before I commit to some nicer bottles. I leave about 1/4 bottle of each of these so that when I get something new I can go back and do a side by side comparison.

Based on the following of what I have already -- what would you recommend I get next for each?

Bourbon: Eagle Rare, Woodford Reserve, Knob Creek
Scotch: Glenmorangie 10, Talisker 10, Glenfiddich 12

I know it's not the case at all, but say for example say Eagle Rare is far east, Woodford Reserve is far west, Knob Creek is far south -- what would you recommend for far north?The Scotch malt map has been super helpful in this regard, but would love some personal anecdotes.

Not really concerned with getting a favorite yet, just want to see everything the world of whiskey has to offer!

My wife and I are expecting twins here in the next month or so I want to buy a nice bottle of whiskey for myself to enjoy. I‚Äôve read some reviews and have been looking at many of the posts here, but I really have no idea which way I‚Äôm leaning. 

What I drink:
Typically, I‚Äôm a beer guy, but I have a few bottles of whiskey and scotch that I enjoy. Currently I have a bottle of crown cask 16, crown reserve, and glenlivet 12. I‚Äôve had these for a couple years, since I don‚Äôt go through them that often. 

I‚Äôve also enjoyed Chivas 18, and quite possibly my favorite I‚Äôve had was Johnnie Walker Blue. 

I‚Äôd like to keep the price around $100-150. I was thinking of getting the blue label, since I enjoyed that quite a bit. I liked the ‚Äúsmoothness‚Äù but immersing myself on this sub, that‚Äôs not really a good attribute to judge a whiskey on?

Avdalicious,c0dme4,2,whiskey,Should you ever use expensive whiskey when making cocktails?,"Hey! I started buying and enjoying whiskey last year, and I mostly drink it like it is without ice. I do however really enjoy whiskey with lemon soda or ginger ale. But for this purpose I always just get a regular Jameson bottle which is fairly cheap. Is there any benefit or point to mixing cocktails like this with more expensive whiskey?
For reference a bottle of Jameson is about 60 dollars where i live, and when I refer to expensive whiskey I‚Äôm generally talking about stuff that might be twice or thrice that price. The idea I got was that the sodas taste is so strong that using more expensive whiskey would have little to none effect.

TheWhiskeyDic,c0nwj6,6,whiskey,Highland Park 12 - Viking Honour Review,"Hey everyone!  Here's a review of Highland Park 12 - Viking Honour!  

**Stats**

**Image:** [Bottle](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s_fSPHCFL1E/maxresdefault.jpg)

**ABV:** 58.5%

**Distillery/Maker:** Highland Park

**Style:** Single Malt Scotch Whisky

**Price: $35-45**

**Aged:** 12 Years

**Company Website:** [https://www.highlandparkwhisky.com](https://www.highlandparkwhisky.com)

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun Facts**

1. The whisky in the bottle is the same as the old 12 year (although the older bottle tended to be older than 12 whereas this one is typically closer to 12)
2. Made on the isle of Orkney using ex-Oloroso sherry casks and ex-Bourbon casks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nose:**  Perhaps it's my own experience, but when I nose this, it smells like what I want a scotch to smell like.¬† The nose is full and almost heavy.¬† Creaminess, slight salt, a bit of graininess but not unpleasant, honey, grass, flowers, apples, pears, maybe a bit of smoke.¬† Very nice nose. 

**Taste:**  The fullness maintains here and the peat is much more prevalent.¬† Saltiness comes out a bit, and most of the fruit notes disappear.¬† The taste is less complex than the nose, but some sweetness remains. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Opinion:**

For the price (about $35 - $40) this is a great every day sipper!  It's something worth gifting, but can also stand as an entry level favorite to keep in your bar.  I enjoy the whole range of Highland Park (that I've tried) so maybe I'm biased, but I really enjoy this one.  I'd encourage you to buy it.

I love drinking whiskey only with mixes, don't have a issue with that at all. However its time to try on the rocks/water but my challenge is when ever i try it i gag straight away, just like taking to many shots in a row haha. 

What i need to know is where to start and what drink to go for, something like i have a nice sip and be like oh yeah i could totally skull this because its so good with out any feeling of vomiting then progress into further whiskeys.

I‚Äôll no doubt be back in a year or so as my wife and I have driven to the Hebridean islands a few times already so I don‚Äôt have to see the ‚Äúessential‚Äù distilleries. 

Any help is appreciated!",6,2019-03-15 04:12:43
Woodsman_Whiskey,b17r0b,3,whiskey,Any suggestions on an additional Irish whiskey to fill out this list?,"I'm going onto a podcast at the end of the month to discuss Irish whiskey. I'll be talking about &amp; doing a tasting session of five whiskeys, but I'm having trouble filling out the final bottle/distillery in my list. My list currently stands at:           
Redbreast        
Green Spot                   
Teelings              
Jameson (standard issue + probably a caskmates or similar)

The though process here is that Redbreast and Green Spot show off the spectrum of what Irish whiskey is about, while I'll be using Teelings to discuss the Irish whiskey revival, what small-medium &amp; startup distilleries in Ireland are doing and that sort of thing. I'm using Jameson as an old classic and probably using it to make a cocktail. 

I'm missing one more. I considered something like a Slane whiskey as another startup distillery but it's not a particularly different or exciting whiskey than anything on the other list. Anyone have any good ideas of something I can add to the list?

MisterBowTies,b18h4u,3,whiskey,My 4 bottle intro to whiskey,"There are TONS of styles and variety but I was thinking about what a good intro bottles to each style would be or one to just have on your bar even if it's not your favorite style. Here are what Id consider a very good example of scotch, bourbon, rye and Irish whiskey to be that is affordable (about $30 each)  and easy to come by

Scotch: Monkey Shoulder, you really taste the toasty malt notes with a hint of spiced citrus honey. I love that it is a blended malt, made by mixing a few well known scotches you can delve into after. 

Irish Whisky: Sexton, this is a great example of a single malt copper pot stilled whisky you get the gentle frutiness that is in redbreast and green spot that I don't get from other Irish Whiskys in the price point

Rye: Rittenhouse is bold and spicy, it is great in cocktails,  which if you aren't a big rye fan is probably why you want rye. If this gets you hooked go back for its older brother pikesville

Bourbon: Eagle Rare gives you all the vanilla, toffee notes you want in a ""classic bourbon"" with added complexity of chocolate and green apples making it worth the the few dollars more to get insted of buffalo trace. 

These are my picks, if you are wanting to get into one of these styles maybe it will help, let me know what you think. ",7,2019-03-15 09:02:49

morris9597,b1yme3,3,whiskey,Whiskey Hunting,"Fellow whiskey enthusiasts!

I am not permitted to imbibe the sweet nectar for approximately 1 month due some medical testing that alcohol may, possibly, though doubtfully, be interfering with. So to scratch the whiskey itch I'v decided to go hunting instead. Whiskey hunting that is. 

I've previously never felt a strong urge to track down such rarities as EH Taylor Small Batch since my favorites are readily available and at low prices (I'm looking at you Elijah Craig Small Batch). However, given my current predicament I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for some more elusive whiskeys that I can occupy myself with trying track down. I'd like to keep selections under $100 per. 

I recently found both EH Taylor Small Batch that I picked (as well as Single Barrel and another even pricier variety neither of which I picked up). And Basil Haydens which I grabbed (BH Dark Rye was also available but I did not grab it). 

Some elusive whiskeys that are readily available in my area that seem to be more elusive in others are Blanton's and Buffalo Trace. Not sure how elusive it is, but Whistle Pig is also widely available. 

I'm also quite interested in scotch but recently found my 2 favorites, both of which have become something of a unicorn in my area: Laphroaig Quartercask and Peat Monster (though I didn't grab the Peat Monster, a decision I now regret).

TL;DR: I'm looking to occupy some myself with tracking down some elusive whiskeys.",10,2019-03-17 07:11:46

WoodstockWhiskey,aqxodg,1,whiskey,Old Forester 1910 Review,"The latest and last addition to the Old Forester ‚ÄúWhiskey Row‚Äù series is another stellar example of the quality juice that‚Äôs coming out of their distillery.

This was a bottle I was kind of interested in after having the Old Forester 1920, but was kind of waiting to see other reviews before I made my purchase.  I heard from a friend who just so happens to be a rep for Brown Forman products in Colorado that the 1910 that was out there now would be all that is available until later in 2019.  Everyone must have been hearing the same news because it took me checking at 3 or 4 stores that I knew used to have it in order to find a bottle.

Coming from the Old Forester 1920 and really enjoying it, I had high hopes for the 1910.  It was a lower ABV at only 93 proof, but still respectable.  The ‚Äúgimmick‚Äù with this particular release is that the bourbon is taken from its original barrel and then placed into a heavily charred barrel to finish.  The result is a full flavored bourbon with hints of charred oak.

On the nose, I get oak and a very sweet vanilla note.  After consulting the tasting notes on their site, I see that this is a buttercream frosting and it fits the description really well.

As an aside, I like to reference the notes on the distiller‚Äôs website to see if their descriptions match what I‚Äôm getting.  Lots of times, I feel like most of us can discern the overarching notes that we find in most bourbons like oak, vanilla and caramel, but the subtle notes are sometimes lost upon us or we know there‚Äôs something else there, but can‚Äôt put our finger on it.  Many times, with the tasting notes provided by the distiller, they can nudge us into the right direction, which may simply just be the power of suggestion, or it could be that those notes really are there. Anyway, I digress.

The palate is very sweet, almost candy-like.  There‚Äôs definite notes of oak and vanilla and it seems as though there‚Äôs a taste of caramel, but it‚Äôs almost burnt.  It‚Äôs not the rich and creamy caramel you‚Äôd find in say Weller Special Reserve, but almost like the taste of caramel you‚Äôve made on the stove and you‚Äôve waited just a few seconds too long before adding the cream.  I‚Äôm sure this is part of the influence of the heavily charred barrel and I must say it is very nice.  The mouthfeel is viscous and coats the mouth, a very welcome trait in my mind.

The finish is oak forward with the char from the barrel being quite noticeable.  There‚Äôs a hint of cedar and then a nice long spicy finish.

This is quite the enjoyable pour, but I still find myself to be more fond of the 1920.  I typically gravitate more towards the higher proof whiskies, so I may just be biased.  However, at around the $55 mark, it‚Äôs a very good bourbon and being lower proof and very sweet, I would recommend this to a newcomer or someone with a sweet tooth.  All in all, I‚Äôd say this is a fine finish to the Whiskey Row series and I look forward to seeing what Old Forester puts out next.

I like Booker's Kitchen Table, Rabbit Hole, Angel's Envy, Journeyman Rye, Woodford Reserve, Buffalo Trace, Collaboration (i wish i lived in KY), and 1792.

I picked up Akashi at my Binnys because its been on my radar for a while but theres just so many kinds.

I know people do this all the time, but I was wondering what people take for 'strategies' when traveling on an airline with booze.  I've read the [TSA guidelines](https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2014/01/07/tsa-travel-tips-tuesday-traveling-alcoholic-beverages), so I know how much I can bring.  

My thought right now is just a couple bottles packed in the middle of my bag, surrounded by my clothes and whatnot.  It'll also just be a short trip, so I'm only going with carry-on luggage (which I might just end up checking at the gate).  

I'm also considering something like a '[Wine Diaper](https://www.amazon.com/Wine-Diaper-Original-Protective-Absorbent/dp/B00308FONW/ref=lp_9510722011_1_3?srs=9510722011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547409816&amp;sr=8-3)' - anyone have any experience with those?

My bottle of Monkey Shoulder quickly turned empty, and during this period I tasted different whiskies in bars and gatherings... I have this habit of purchasing the entire range once I have tasted one and loved it. I tried the Dalmore 15 in one of my gathering and I added the 12, 18, CigarMalt, Port Wood Reserve, KA3 to my collection. There is this thought in my head that I need to have them all. Heck its not like they are getting discontinued?

&amp;#x200B;

1 year later I end up having full sets distillery bottlings of Dalmores, Aberlours, Glenfiddichs, Wolfburns. Don't get me wrong I do open them to drink but I keep only 3 open bottles at any time (plus one bottle of JW White Walker in the freezer... yucks), its just that the rate of me adding new bottles onto the shelves is a lot quicker than me emptying those bottles. I did stop myself from getting more Hibiki and Nikkas though.

I called USPS and the agent I spoke to was really nice but basically just said it's out of their (USPS) hands and entirely on CBP to process.

Neversafeforlife,a6892l,1,whiskey,/r/Whiskey is looking for new moderators.,"First off a big thank you to Razz. No matter what you think of his bottle porn rule he really helped make this subreddit better in many ways. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I‚Äôll cut the shit here. Moderating this subreddit can be very difficult as an enthusiast. A ton of the content consists of shitposts and people asking for recommendations that have been asked 10000000 times over. 

People upset about mod decisions have literally threatened to track down and kill me. They might also follow you around reddit and fuck with you endlessly. 

&amp;nbsp;

It can also be fun. Setup a dumb theme day/week, make ridiculous shitposts for a laugh, ban idiots and flex your mod power cuz why not?

***

Anyways, comment here why you want to be a moderator. What ideas you may have to help us grow or drive quality content, what experience you have as a moderator, do you know css? Shit like that. ",17,2018-12-15 03:57:04

What are your thoughts on getting these 3 (plus two custom engraved glasses with our initials on them - one glass with mine, one glass with his).

For instance, I brought home a Suntory Special Reserve from Japan, which I can't buy here.

This is no doubt a gem of Canadian Rye that is much sought after come October-November each year. Bottles fly off shelves.

Living in Canada and following international whisky trends makes it is hard not to notice the hype train surrounding High West‚Äôs A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dram. It would appear that this blend of ryes is wanted by many when each year south of the border and is generally reviewed favourably.

Because of the rarity of each, and the fact that neither bottle becomes very much available in the opposing country, I am curious if anyone out there actually has sampled each. Obviously one is a blend and the other is not, but nonetheless I thought I would see if anyone has tried each what what their preference is between the two.

Just to be clear - I am not talking about the regular Lot 40 rye, which is delicious in its own right. I am talking about the annual limited release which in 2017 was a 12 year and in 2018 was an 11 year.",5,2018-12-18 14:59:56

Some booths were supposed to have opened fancy bottles at intervals (e.g. the JW booth opened a bottle of King George V while I was in line for the breathalyzer), but I wasn't even thinking about trying the most expensive stuff. I just wanted to find stuff that suited my tastes at a price point that I could afford to buy on a regular basis.

I found that my palate isn't refined enough for smoky, despite it being the description that appealed to me the most on paper. Ardbeg Corryvreckan nearly made me cough! I loved Kavalan Amontillado but when I looked at the price list, I was contented with a glass lol. Among the blended stuff, Maker's Mark Private Select was delicious but the price was also eye-popping.

I ended up going home with Balvenie Carribean Cask and Auchentoshan Three Wood for sipping and Raasay While We Wait, JW Gold Reserve, and 3 bottles of Celtic Honey for either cocktails or when friends come over. Burned a sizable hole in my pocket but I'm already looking forward to the next event!",9,2018-11-15 02:52:11

I realized something today that I‚Äôve ‚Äúdealt‚Äù with ever since I started tasting whiskey.  Sometimes I will take a sip and feel like I got to experience all the flavors and nuances of a whiskey and hardly feel like I‚Äôm drinking a spirit.

Other times, I‚Äôll take a sip and when I swallow it feels like I drank straight ethanol - my tongue and throat get that characteristic alcohol burn and I can hardly pick any notes out of it.

These can both pop up randomly for me, even out of the same glass.  I really wanted to see if anyone else experiences this, and if anyone had any thoughts.  Do you think it‚Äôs something like the amount of saliva in my mouth, the amount of whiskey I sip, how long I keep the whiskey in my mouth, what parts of my tongue it hits, etc.?

jaerie,9x70im,1,whiskey,Tried my first review,"I've had plenty of discussions with all kinds of whiskey drinkers, from enthusiasts though brewers/distillers(not sure which is the proper English name). Never tried a self-written review, though, until now. Got a whiskey I had never heard of, so figured it might be nice to describe my experience, without any sort of predesposition. I tried to balance typical descriptions with accessible language, so that it doesn't sound too pretentious (which I hate).

The whiskey is Douglas Laing's Provenance 11, distilled by Benrinnes in May 2006, bottle in November 2017. I think that uniquely defines the bottle, if not, please let me know. 

I'd love to hear feedback, both on the specific whiskey and my general writing style. It's my first try, so please be anything but kind.

Here it is:

A great balance between smooth and complex. In this price class, the oddly translucent Benrinnes delivers a surprising depth of flavor, breaking the usual color correlations of mid to mid-high range whiskeys. Prominent dark aromas like cocao and espresso almost mask the slight smokiness and a hint of tutti frutti. The short swallow reveals a mild fig-like sweetness, teasing the tutti frutti once again. A longer pull justifies the years noted on the bottle, with the expectations brought forth by the aroma made whole. The slight bourbon-esque fuses with a fruitiness of the berry family. Thicker sweet fruits, like the fig from the first impression make a reappearance, albeit in a second rank. 
The whole experience surprises, from a boring looking bottle with a cheap bright color, to a friendly multidimensional travel through the more typical of flavors. A great bottle for the junior whiskey fanatic who wishes to expand his territory, without having to break his spirit with ashtrays and caskstrength. ",6,2018-11-15 10:42:25

I'm still learning and trying to acquire the taste, so I don't get all the subtleties... so how do you identify the flavor that matches your mood? 

I have 3 bottles of whiskey (Michter's, Woodford Reserve, and Glenmorangie).

I know I want a whiskey now, but I don't really know which one I fancy.

I don't want to say I don't care which one, it's just that, right now, they taste a little bit similar to my taste buds. I don't know how to choose.

I can tell some differences between them but not enough to distinguish them, so I don't know how to choose the right one according to my mood.... if that makes any sense.

amca01,9xlvxl,4,whiskey,An amateur drinks Pikesville 110 Rye,"I've been drinking whisk(e)y all my life; mainly scotch single malts and a few blends; more recently bourbon.  And I've picked up the idea that rye is in many ways America's more ""signature"" whiskey - if a single whiskey style was to define America, it would be rye.  So to test this notion I bought a bottle of Pikesville 110 (not cheap here in Australia).  Most reviews or descriptions of rye seem to talk about it being ""spicy"" and ""hot"", and these were certainly the first effects as I carefully nosed a splash in my glass - I was going to drink it neat.  A peppery, cinnamon-y, mown-grass-y sort of smell; a rich wildness, a smell almost of untamed-ness.  This is not a parlour whiskey.  

Next: to the mouth, and the promise of spicy heat didn't disappoint, although even at 110 proof it's not hard to drink (in small sips, in my case).  I must say I found the first few mouthfuls a bit difficult: I was getting a spiciness to be sure, but I wasn't really enjoying it - I couldn't get a sense of flavour through the spice.  It was sort of like a spicy covering over a rather flavourless middle.  But I think this was me wrestling with a very unfamiliar style.  By the end of the glass I was getting a fuller and richer taste - and the famed cherry cola taste could be noted.  I actually don't like cherry cola, and maybe it was the hint of this that first put me off.  But in the context of this whiskey I began to enjoy it more, and by sips seven or eight I was beginning to get a better sense of the taste, although still dominated by the spice.

I have no idea where Pikesville stands in the rye world - I know it's picked up numerous awards, and I've seen it recommended in lots of places.  Whether it's a good ""starting"" rye I don't know.  But to me, who usually drinks without being too fussy about it, it's a change from the rounder, sweeter, bourbons, and of course to Scottish malts.  I suspect it will take me a little time and a few more glasses to really enjoy it - which I'm sure I will - and it's a journey I'm looking forward to.

Tldr: Johnny Walker Blue, but cheaper. 

Story time for those wondering why I'm being a cheap ass with my wonderful grandpa.

Last year I went on a trip with my boyfriend to visit his family out of state. My grandpa watched my dogs for me. It would have cost $300 or more to kennel them, but more importantly they are old, spoiled dogs and I didn't want them to be scared or confused since they've never been kenneled before. My saint of a grandpa came over twice a day to feed them, let them outside and play with them a bit. 

I was trying to think of a good thank you gift. Like most ex military dudes, he likes a good drink. I can't remember his usual but it's about $50 for a handle and he adds a bit of water or ice to make it smoother. My grandma rations him to two fingers a day, she keeps track of every cent of their money so he can't buy more than she allows him to buy, but family frequently gifts him secret booze and he hides it in his garage and drinks it when she's not paying attention. Once a year we'll get a frantic call because she thinks he's having a stroke, but he's just drunk and slurring and she can't understand him. 

Yeah, that's a lot to unpack, but he's 80. His doctors are amazed at how healthy he is and if it gives him joy to drink (especially the challenge of doing it behind grandma's back) then that's the perfect gift.

I bought him a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue because I heard it was smooth and it was in a price range appropriate for his generosity... Well sort of. I think he deserves MORE but I knew if he knew how much it cost he'd have a fit. I knew he'd probably think it was dumb to spend that much money on something but he's old. He should be enjoying the finer things in life and he wouldn't be so bold as to Google the price...

He went home and googled the price. He called me imediately and chewed me out for spending so much on him. I told him kenneling would cost more, he still saved me money and my doggos were much better off just chilling at home. I still got the better end of the deal, just drink the booze or regift it.

He said ""Well next time just get me $200 worth of the cheap stuff then! Shit can't be worth $200 for fucks sake!"" I said ""How the hell will you hide four handles of booze from Grandma?!"" He said ""I have my ways"" I said ""Nah I'm not going to be responsible for that much contraband. Get your own cheap stuff old man, just use this for special occasions to enjoy and savor.""  He grumbled and complained a little more about how stupid and it was and hung up the phone. 

About a month later I'm woken up to the sound of banging in my kitchen. I have a fenced in yard, but I don't lock my backdoor. I get up to investigate and I see my damn Grandpa in the kitchen ""You need to do your dishes kid, where's a clean cup? You gotta try this shit!"" It was 10am by the way. 

Apparently my cousin was in town, and him and my grandpa cracked open the bottle the night before. They saved a little for me to try. ""This is so smooth I didn't even have to water it down, just enjoyed the taste!"". I took a sip, but it just tasted like booze I can't handle. I pretended ""Oh yeah it's good, so smooth. Thanks for letting me try it. Glad you liked it."" 

Crazy old man liked it so much his drunk ass made sure to save me some, hopped my fence and broke into my kitchen to have me try it at 10am the next day. I love that dude. 

I don't know what smooth means in relation to whisky. I'm made of weakness, and it all tastes like I'm being hit in the face with a campfire. So if one of you more refined people can offer me a suggestion for a 'smooth' whiskey that is in a price range that won't be too audacious to my grandpa ($50 to $75) I would be eternally grateful.",12,2018-11-18 07:11:05

 The only thing I seem to be able to distinguish is the warehouse number and the barrel number. No other place on the bottle gives that information away. I will include a picture of one of my bottles for reference. Also there was no additional information on the tag it came with either. :(

BottleJackStand,9ypny9,1,whiskey,"New to Whiskey, looking for some recommendations to add to my Xmas List","Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the sidebar FAQs, but still can't make up my mind based on my being new to whiskey. I'm looking for some whiskey's to put on my Xmas List, but don't know where to begin. I can tell you below what I like/dislike out of the bourbons/whiskeys I have tried.

&amp;#x200B;

For Whiskey:

1. Jameson - Absolutely disgusting, it actually made me sick lol.
2. Jack Daniels Single Barrel Select - Found it lovely, drank it neat no problem.
3. Johnny Walker Red/Black - Horrible, don't like them at all, unless mixed.
4. Crown Royale - Absolutely disgusting, tastes like garbage, wouldn't even drink it mixed.
5. Jack Daniels Honey Whiskey - Found it smooth with just a touch of honey.
6. Jim Beam Maple Bourbon - Found it cloyingly sweet (probably the maple syrup), but found the underlying bourbon to be good.

For Bourbon:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Maker's Mark - Found it sweet, smooth, and velvety. I was able to sip this neat without issue.
2. Evan Williams Black Label - Found it Repulsive and ashy. I only like drinking it mixed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some general tastes I like in these types of spirits: Vanilla, Earthy/Woodsy/Oaky, Tobacco, Peppery, and Sweet like brown/turbinado sugar (which the sidebar said Evan Williams had strong notes of, but I didn't taste any of that lol). 

 

Thanks for any advice/help!",4,2018-11-20 14:45:30

TheWhiskeyDic,9ozaql,1,whiskey,Metallica's Blackened! [Whiskey Review],"Hey all!  I am excited because I got to review ""Blackened"", another awesome whiskey made by Dave Pickerell with involvement from Metallica!  If you'd prefer a video version, check the bottom of this post.

**Stats**

**Image:** [Bottle](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8fPwo4cftHY/maxresdefault.jpg)

**ABV:** 45%

**Distillery/Maker:** Sweet Amber Distilling Co

**Style:** Blended American Whiskey

**Price:** [$36](https://www.totalwine.com/spirits/american-whiskey/whiskey/blackened-american-whiskey/p/218584750?s=1903&amp;igrules=true) (TotalWine price, no affiliation)

**Aged:** ?

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun Facts**

1. This whiskey is a blend of Rye, Bourbon, and American Whiskies, and was created by Dave Pickerell who spend 17 years working at Maker's Mark and is the active Master Distiller at Whistlepig.
2. The whiskey comes to Sweet Amber Distilling Co fully aged, but they mature it in Black Brandy Barrels using a Sonic Maturation process that they have dubbed ""Black Noise"".  This vibrates the crap out of the barrels and supposedly helps the whiskey go further into the barrel.  This is done for between 12 and 20 weeks.
3. The sound played at the barrel is, unsurprisingly, Metallia... you can view the playlists [here](https://blackenedwhiskey.com/batch-playlists/) on their website.
4. There are 5000 bottles per batch, and the batch started on #81 (1981 being the year that Metallica was formed)

**Nose:** Toasted Caramel, as if you were melting it over your own stove.  Honey, Oak.

**Taste:** Very Mildly Spicey, Honey, Apricot, Cinnamon, Butterscotch.  Mostly smooth.  Very drinkable.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Opinion:**

Coming off the Conor McGregor craft whiskey into this one, I was very nervous with my first sip which happened to be on a live stream... I was relieved when not only did it not suck, but I actually really liked it!  This whiskey is between $35 and $43 dollars, and as an American Whiskey it's something that I think is special.

Doing what I do, I get the joy of trying LOTS of different whiskies, and I notice a lot of similarities between them... this whiskey is different.  It's different from the nose to the finish and at $40 I think it's perfectly priced for a craft whiskey.  I think you should get a bottle in your collection.  Go out and get a bottle because as far as celebrity endorsed alcohol goes, this is a good one.

I have used Whistlepig &amp; Bulleit also and was looking to try a new rye. I saw this one and was curious. I like drinking scotches that have port or sherry barrel as part of the process (Yes, I recognize that Basil Hayden has port directly added).

I get a big ice cube and drink it straight, and find it to be similar (to me) as a Rye Manhattan. I like having a glass after work or with a cigar. 

Again, I know the purists are going to start doing their dance of ""This isn't the purist of the pure! How dare you post such filth on our haven of perfect whiskey!""

Much of the general store was accurate to pictures of stores I'd seen from family photos, with tools like tobacco plug cutters and wood stoves. One thing that stuck out at me was the bottles of boxed whiskey in the back, near the door.

My dad, who's about 70 now, said that general stores and hardware stoes did indeed sell lliquor, esp. in rural areas, but he could not add details because he was too little to buy any.

I'm wondering, what brands or forms of liquor did these store tend to carry? My guess is that your choices were limited to bourbon, scotch, and maybe a few other forms of domestic liquor, with such brands as Old Crow, Four Roses, Kentucky Gentleman, and EJ being the most common. But it would be nice just to satisfy the curiousity without outside perspectives.

I'll start off by saying yes I did try this because Conor mcgregor - but the flavor kept me for a second try. 

On first smell you get an isopropyl/sharpie smell. As some blogs have stated that I‚Äôve read this is due to it not being in casks long enough. This is really what you must get past as it‚Äôs a very apparent flavor that masks the great part about this whiskey. The end notes are Vanilla/honey/Caramel and it tastes fantastic. I wouldn't really choose between this and Jameson, I'd buy both for different purposes (Car bombs come to mind vs Irish mules) 

I like drinking this with ginger beer served cold, no ice. It really masks that initial flavor and lets the whiskeys true delights shine through. Honestly this is where this whiskey shines through ‚Äì it absolutely tastes fantastic in a ratio of 2:3 or 2:4 with the two being proper 12.

thewhiskeyshelf,9g6zsq,6,whiskey,The Whiskey Shelf Review #1: Maker's Mark Cask Strength (Batch 15-05),"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dks2po0gbim11.jpg

This, and other reviews, can be found at my whiskey blog called ""The Whiskey Shelf"", [https://www.thewhiskeyshelf.com/makers-mark-cask-strength/](https://www.thewhiskeyshelf.com/makers-mark-cask-strength/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Distillery:** Maker‚Äôs Mark

**Region:** Kentucky, USA

**Type:** Bourbon (wheated)

**Alcohol:** 55.15%

**Composition:** 70% corn, 16% soft winter wheat, 14% malted barley

**Aged:** NAS (rumored \~6 years), aged in virgin American white oak

**Price:** $17 on sale (375mL), but likely $50-70 normally

 

# Overview

Maker‚Äôs Mark is a legendary global whiskey brand, and one of the first to create a premium image decades ago for its bourbon. Unlike many other brands, Maker‚Äôs Mark only has 2 products, with some variations added to it: original Maker‚Äôs Mark and Maker‚Äôs 46. I was lucky enough to visit the distillery and go on their tour a few years ago, and remember buying my first bottle of the cask strength variety as part of the tour. I really enjoyed it and even got to dip my own bottle in wax. While this product was initially only sold at the distillery, distribution expanded more recently to the entire US.

A little more commentary on wheated bourbon: rye is the more common grain used as a secondary grain in bourbon, but there are a handful that replace rye with wheat, creating different tastes and smells. Wheat is supposed to help create a smoother and sweeter bourbon, whereas rye adds spice and mint. Think about the difference between wheat bread and rye bread, and you can imagine how the two might taste different in bourbon. There aren‚Äôt that many wheated bourbons on the market, but that number is growing.

 

# Smell

Maker‚Äôs Mark did not exaggerate when they said ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù. The first sniff is **incredibly smooth** and **mellow**, with only a hint of the 55% alcohol hidden inside that you would expect to flatten you. Even as I sniff harder to try to overwhelm my nose, it still doesn‚Äôt happen.

The smells are also incredibly ‚Äúamped-up‚Äù as Maker‚Äôs Mark says. There‚Äôs a combination of **honey, brown sugar, maple syrup, caramel**, and **vanilla** that screams **pecan pie**. The scent is especially prominent when I‚Äôm nearly done and all I can smell is the liquid that coats the glass. Additional sniffs also reveal some **wood oak and cinnamon**, as is expected from bourbon. The sweet notes are strong, but stand-out enough to balance the alcohol and wood.

On top of the sweetness, there are strong **floral, herbal, grassy, and earthy** notes, like **standing in the middle of a field**, as well as a touch of **sourdough bread** and **yeast**. This combination of sweet and floral also reminds me of **sweet tea** with only a dash of sugar.

**All in all, Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength smells like you‚Äôre walking through a field in the middle of summer with a pecan pie in your hand going to your friend‚Äôs house for dinner.** It‚Äôs a lovely smell.

# 

# Taste &amp; Aftertaste

No surprise, but this tastes like it smells. Every sip is **intense, yet smooth and complex**. The alcohol is noticeable but never overpowering for me, but nevertheless may overwhelm others. On my first sip, I immediately notice a **moderate sweetness of brown sugar**. The longer I leave it in my mouth, the more I taste the **cinnamon** and **wood spice** as the alcohol coats my mouth and begins to burn.

On subsequent sips where I intentionally leave the liquid in my mouth for 10 seconds, Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength develops **citrus, cherry, herbal, and sour cornmeal** flavors (but only a little). The taste of sour cornmeal, like **bourbon mash right before distillation**, also appears. It‚Äôs a little sweet and savory from the corn, but also sour from fermentation. For me, the sour note is unique to Maker‚Äôs Mark. If you ever get a chance to try the mash while on a tour, definitely go for it. Just make sure you ask for permission first from your guide.

The aftertaste is **grassy** and **floral**. After I swallow, there immediately is a **gentle dryness and bitterness**, reminiscent of **black tea**. There‚Äôs also something there akin to **salted peanuts.** The aftertaste is not as sweet as expected given its smell and taste, but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. This leaves my mouth pretty dry, especially when I leave it in my mouth for 10+ seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

# Overall Score: 82 (Top Shelf)

Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength is an **incredibly rich and delicious bourbon**. It‚Äôs a **multifaceted drink that demands that you sit down and savor it**. The wheat provides exceptional flavor and smoothness, making the 55% bourbon less punchy than you would expect. Nevertheless, it is still very potent and thick.

With only a few wheated bourbons in the market, and many of them extremely difficult to find (e.g., Weller, Pappy, Parker‚Äôs Heritage), and most mass-market competition coming from Larceny and Rebel Yell, **Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength is an excellent buy**, even at the $50-60 price point.

When I previously did a tasting of cask strength bourbons (1792 Full Proof, Bulleit Barrel Strength, and Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength), I found Maker‚Äôs Mark to be by-and-far better than the other two. I highly recommend it, and have actually purchased 4 of these smaller bottles because it‚Äôs just that good.

# Rating System

**‚Äì The Glass Case** (90-100): A truly exceptional whiskey with flawless smell and taste that should be treasured, savored, and shared with your closest friends. It makes me say, ‚Äúwow, this is one of the the best drinks I‚Äôve ever had‚Äù. Very few whiskeys will ever receive this rating.

**‚Äì Top Shelf** (80-89): A great whiskey worth buying, with standout smells and flavors, but with some small flaws. It makes me say, ‚Äúwow this is amazing‚Äù. Many of my favorite whiskeys fall into this category.

**‚Äì Mid Shelf** (70-79): A solid whiskey with good qualities, but lacks standout traits that makes it interesting. It also has significant flaws that detract from the overall experience. It makes me say, ‚Äúthis is pretty good‚Äù.

**‚Äì Bottom Shelf** (60-69): A not very good, but drinkable whiskey. It has one or two positive traits, but significantly more flaws, especially with taste.

**‚Äì Don‚Äôt Even Put On the Shelf** (50-59): A bad whiskey not worth drinking. There is nothing good about it. Your money will be better spent elsewhere.",0,2018-09-16 09:58:07

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting more and more into whiskey lately, with lots of different bourbons, a few scotches, and on a whim a bottle of Suntory Toki. I found it definitely interesting and very drinkable, but I see why other posters here find it a little underwhelming, with a little too much raw alcohol seeping in. However, my wife tried it and absolutely loved it, both for its lightness and the sweet floral notes. As we finish up the bottle, I'm wondering what else might be a good fit. I see Compass Box Great King Street Artist's Blend as an option, but I haven't seen that one available locally. Are the other NAS Japanese offerings like Mars going to offer something similar? It's a little difficult to parse the sub for recommendations because I sort of feel like what she likes about it is the sort of thing that people posting reviews on /r/whiskey might not be into.

Marshmallow_64,9gqmyx,3,whiskey,Whiskey Storage and How Long it Lasts,"I know this has probably been posted before but I wanted to hear some anecdotal answers on the topic. From my research it is generally believed that if a whiskey is unopened and stored correctly (dark place away from the sun, room temp, no cork leakage), it will last forever. An opened bottle with 3/4 of more will last up to 5 years, half empty bottle will last 2-3 years, and 1/3 or less will need to be finished in a few months. The claim is that the more air in a bottle the faster the whiskey will oxidize, thus changing the taste.

I recently heard from Horst Leuning on his youtube channel, that very old ages of whiskey are not affected by oxidization, since they have already been fully oxidized in the barrel. What is everyone's experiences on the matter?",5,2018-09-18 10:02:18

All part of the Journey
POSTED AUGUST 15, 2018 SCOTCH 4 DUMMIES
Greasing the wheels

This week we reviewed a bribe bottle.  Not a huge bribe, but the kind no one really had a problem with in the first place.  I felt I had to buy a bottle of Tamdhu to complement a bottle we were gifted and, the best place to search out anything that may be challenging to locate is, of course, on the internet.  I quickly located my bottle at www.caskers.com and added it to the cart.  This is where the bribe comes in.  It is only a couple of dollars more to ship 2 bottles instead of one, and so I went to browse the selection.  That was where I discovered this beautiful bottle that we had heard some great things about and added it to the collection so no one would ask too many questions.

                       The journey is the best part

While getting ready to shoot this review, I went back to my notes about Deanston history.   I love the fact that this distillery is young in terms of scotch distilleries, and was actually a cotton mill since the late 1700‚Äôs.  The history of the community centered around the success and expansion of this business for almost 200 years until the mill closed.  This is the best part of the story for me because rather than allow the community to decline it decided to reinvent itself.  They began a distillery in the 1960‚Äôs and I am so happy this was the way they chose to revive industry in the village.  The whisky they produce here is flavorful, complex, and thoroughly enjoyable while remaining affordable.

The flavor of this scotch would be enough to keep me coming back, but I love the story of this distillery.  Deanston feels like the underdog in this story since the shutting down of the only industry in a community has been the downfall of countless towns and villages before.  That could have been the story here as well, but it turned out they beat the odds and now we all have the chance to enjoy a great dram from an underdog.

Scotch 4 Dummies really started as a reason to get together and discover new whisky.  On our journey, we have been introduced, by chance or by more knowledgeable peers, to several distilleries that I can‚Äôt say enough about.  They are the reason I will throw down $50-$100 to buy a bottle from a distillery I know nothing about on the chance it is amazing.   Deanston is one of those distilleries.  I had never heard of the distillery before we started reviewing scotch but, now that I have tried a few bottles, I will never forget it.  The story plus the amazing scotch will keep me coming to the bar every Thursday for a long time.  If you don‚Äôt believe me, buy a bottle and have a dram while you watch the review.  It‚Äôs the best way to watch us anyway.

This will be a four-year program and will probably break off pieces of my soul with each year. I want to get some whiskey to help with that! I would like to find a decent whiskey that I will buy this week and not open until the day I graduate. I plan to keep it on the top shelf of my desk to keep me motivated throughout my program. 

I'd like to find a higher quality whiskey than what I'm used to, which would be $50-$100. I'm actually going on a few distillery and brewery tours this week in the Texas Hill Country as a fun trip before school starts. I'm for sure going to the Balcones Distillery and Rebecca Creek Distillery. I have actually never had their whiskey before, but if I like it I might get a bottle from them. 

I most frequently drink: 

jim Bean

Jim Bean Bottled in Bond

Jim Bean Black Label (I guess I really like Jim Bean)

Evan Williams (when the money is tight)

My favorite whiskeys so far are: 

Jim Bean Devil's Cut

1835

Can anyone give me some advice on a good Texas Whiskey between $50-$100 that I would enjoy 4 years from now? Thanks for any recommendations y'all have! ",17,2018-08-18 00:49:36
whskyrw,984c4n,12,whiskey,Is it Whisky or Whiskey?,"*Processing img dluletl9xog11...*

There are two ways to spell whiskey: ending with a ‚Äúy‚Äù or an ‚Äúey.‚Äù Knowing what spelling to use is primarily dependent upon the country where the spirit is produced. The Scottish, Japanese, and Canadians spell it whisky (*no e*). The Irish and the Americans spell it whisk***ey***.  
   
A simple trick to remember this is if the country has an ‚Äúe‚Äù in its name, they spell it ‚Äúwhiskey.‚Äù  
   
United States. American Whisk***ey***.  
Ireland. Irish Whisk***ey***.  
Japan. Japanese Whisk*y*.  
Scotland. Scotch Whisk*y*.  
Canada. Canadian Whisk*y*.  
   
To add to the confusion, there are also exceptions to the rule (Makers Mark Whisky for example). Also, in typical lets-make-no-sense-fashion, the U.S. federal regulatory definition of the spirit spells *Whisky*. So clearly there is not even a national understanding of what is correct. Either that and/or some Scotch drinking law makers had a good laugh passing the Bill.  
   
There is little to be gained in proving you are a whiskey spelling bee champion at a bar. If one should encounter a pretentious spirits ‚Äúexpert‚Äù making a big deal of how to properly spell whiskey, *tell them to pass the bottle and quit being an a\*\*hole!*",17,2018-08-18 01:42:34

Rarely do I get a bourbon that has no particular redeeming characteristics, but this was one. It had a strong charcoal taste, almost overpowering. It was so bad, I actually dumped it. Normally I'll keep a bottle around that I don't necessarily like because maybe someone else will like it, but I didn't think this one was remotely worth the space. The worst part was that they aged it for 10 years and it was STILL that bad. I actually like Wild Turkey, but this was not a good aged effort. I can think of over a dozen better bourbons, aged for less time, for equal or less. 

Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but damn this was not good.",5,2018-08-18 14:50:28

So September 16 I'll be heading to London and then train to France for our Honeymoon. I love Scotch - so I'm super excited to try to pick up some hard to find Whiskey over there.

So - I have a handful of questions!!!

1 - I'll be flying into London, then taking a train to France, then flying back into the States (I believe DC on the way in). From what I've read, I can bring 2 Liters into France, and 5 Liters into the US (per person) without having to pay tax. Does this apply to Duty Free Whiskey - or is this total? Is the above information correct?

2 - Are prices cheaper for Scotch over in London/France? Example - I have a hard-on for Dalmore. Really want to pickup a 15yr, 18yr, Cigar Malt, and King Alexander III (And any other rare ones) - but prices in Tennessee are $129/$199/$189/$319 respectively. Would I be able to find Dalmore, Macallan, Glenfiddich, etc for cheaper over there?

3 - What are some great bottles I can get over there that I can get in the US that I should keep an eye out for?

4 - Anything else I should know or be aware of?",7,2018-08-23 21:51:14

**Distillery/Maker:** [Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey](http://www.unclenearest.com)

**Style:** Currently a blend of bourbons... but soon to be a Tennessee Whiskey (their Uncle Nearest Silver)

**Price:** [$55](https://www.totalwine.com/spirits/american-whiskey/tennessee-whiskey/uncle-nearest-1856/p/190682750?s=303&amp;igrules=true) (totalwine price, no affiliation)

**Aged:** ?

**Fun Facts**

1. Uncle Nearest's real name was Nathan Green, and he's recognized as the first African American head stiller (a title synonymous with today's ""Master Distiller"").
2. Nathan Green was a mentor to Jasper ""Jack"" Daniels and taught him about distilling.
3. Nathan was associated with helping to perfect the Lincoln County Filtration system.  (Charcoal filtering).

**Nose:**  Oak, Caramel, Corn, Cinnamon, Vanilla 

**Taste:**  Oak, Caramel, Corn, Cinnamon, Vanilla 

*First time I've reviewed a whiskey where the nose and taste gave me identical notes.*

**My Opinion:**

When I first tried Uncle Nearest Whiskey I didn't like it all that much.  I tried it with a friend and we were both pretty much in agreement that it was not a great dram... 

I gave it a couple of months while waiting to do a review on it, mostly just putting it off... however, I found that when I came back to it 2/3 months later, it had relaxed a bit and the taste changed.  It got better with time.  I actually ended up overdrinking a bit because I didn't realize it was 100 proof!  The headache the next morning caused me to look at the bottle and realize that it wasn't just another 80 proof whiskey.

I'm still going to give this a pretty lukewarm recommendation, and suggest you try it if you run across it, but I'd suggest waiting until their Uncle Nearest Silver is fully aged.  (that's their own distillate).

That being said, this is still and award winning whiskey, so if you enjoy it, you're not alone!

Thanks for reading!

thomasredden,90v9fv,27,whiskey,Cheap whiskey isn't bad whiskey. If you find a niche that you enjoy it isn't bad to build your collection around that,"So I've lurked on a lot of these whisk(e)y subs for a while and I've noticed that beginners often come to these subs in search of where they should start or continue to build a collection of whiskey that not only they will like but friends can enjoy too. However, if you find a region of whisk(e)y that you enjoy, don't be ashamed to enjoy that and to explore other whisk(e)y like it, and when you try a new type of whisk(e)y or are trying to Branch out into other regions, try multiple good but less expensive bottles rather then going for expensive high end whisk(e)y from that region, you can often get a better feel for your take on that type of whisk(e)y. Oftentimes the more expensive bottles are the characteristics of a particular region emboldened, making it harder to ease your way in and get a real feel for that region. So just do you folks, if you find your niche and you really like something, don't be afraid to enjoy that niche, and when and if you branch out, don't feel like you have to try the most expensive whisk(e)y a region has to offer to get a real honest refection of what that region has to offer. (Except Canada, it's all crown in cool bottles(I kid I kid))

Brings the collection to be: 

Scotch Single Malts: Deveron 12, Aberlour 12, Lismore

Scotch Blends: Johnny Walker Red, Johnny Walker Black

Irish: Redbreast 21, Redbreast 15, Bushmills 16, Powers Gold Label

Bourbon: Bulleit, Woodford Reserve Double Oak, Angels Envy

Rye:  Kooper Family Rye, A Midwinters' Nights Dram 

I know I have to up my Scotch blend game - that's probably next with killing the JW Red and replacing it with a Dewars or Monkey Shoulder.  The Lismore is absolute dreck - honestly taking up room on the shelf and I'm tempted to pour it out.  Probably replace that with another from the Last Great Malts series.  

I think I'm good up and down on the Bourbons right now.

We'll see if the Kooper makes for a good mixer for drinks as I won't be doing that with the MWND. I honestly don't know anything about the Kooper except that its made in small batches, has a cool label, interesting website and comes from a local distillery.      

I won't be replacing the Powers when its killed, but with two Redbreast and the Bushmills 16 I think I'm set on Irish for a while. 

Glaring hole is a Japanese whisky - and dang-it, it's highball season right now. . .

I‚Äôm willing to spend $150-200, +\- $50 if something is on the edge of those prices. I read the guides, but I wanted to ask for feedback just because y‚Äôall might offer something I never would have considered. 

We‚Äôve recently gotten into sampling scotch and have been loving on the Talisker 10. I know she prefers Islay and has tried and liked Ardberg, Laugavulin, and Laphroaig. 

Bourbon - Buffalo Trace is her favorite. She also enjoyed this bottle of Willett Reserve 2 year I picked up awhile back. She‚Äôs mentioned Boone County as one that she likes, but I‚Äôve not had this one to be familiar. 

Rye - Whistlepig Rye 10 and Lot 40 have been wins in her book. 

Canadian whiskey - She is not big on Crown or Pendleton, but she‚Äôs liked the ryes I have brought when I visit. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve provided enough detail or not. I‚Äôll be happy to provide more after work and/or answer private messages later since I‚Äôm just on break right now. 

Thank you for your time and consideration! I really appreciate your help. ",10,2018-07-26 01:50:05

mslngr0,8rpd7t,1,whiskey,I tried whiskey for the first time - I didn't like it.,"Yesterday evening I decided to try whiskey for the first time and opened a bottle of Jack Daniel's Old No 7 that I had bought a wile ago.

Well I took a nice old fashioned glass, put three ice cubes in it and poured about 50ml of Jack in it. I had quite big expectations of it - after all it was Frank Sinatra's favourite. Needless for you to say it tasted like piss and I could hardly finish it [...]

It wasn't the high alcohol volume that was the problem but the strange bitterish taste it had. After the ice cubes had dissolved and I poured some honey into the whiskey it was slightly more drinkable though it now tasted like a liqueur made of Jack Daniel's. 

However I do not yet want to give up on whiskey - what are some good whiskeys you would suggest that... don't taste like Jack Daniel's? Thank you.

GhostsofLayer8,8t6b9g,3,whiskey,Question on taste,"I've had an experience with a couple whiskies that I'm having trouble finding info on, and I'm hoping someone can point me towards a reason.  Sorry in advance for the low wall of text.

A few years ago, I bought a bottle of Balvenie, pretty certain it was a 15 year old and wasn't finished in sherry or other flavor casks.  When I opened it, it just smelled off.  Fermentation is probably the best description for it, just a ""rotten"" off-putting smell.  I tried a dram, and got a very strong sour/rotten flavor from it and after a couple attempts with subsequent pours, with water and letting it air for over an hour, I just dumped the bottle because it was undrinkable.  Assuming it was a fluke, a bad bottle, I moved on but haven't bought any Balvenie since.

A couple weeks ago, I picked up a small bottle of ""Classic Laddie"" while at Bruichladdich.  I love their Port Charlotte line, but hadn't had the classic before.  When I opened it, I got what smelled like that same rotten or fermentation smell.  The flavor was pretty similar as well.  Just, bad.  I powered through a first pour, and a couple days later tried letting another one air, tried water, nothing worked.  Again, figured something was off and moved on.

What triggered this was smelling Balvenie again the other day, and getting that same scent.  Smelling it again after 3 years makes me think my ""bad"" bottle wasn't actually bad, and that I'm sensitive to a chemical or something that others don't notice.  Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this, or am I just rambling?  I'd love to find an explanation, so I can both avoid it in future, and maybe help someone else out down the road when it happens to them.",2,2018-06-23 08:50:42

I need to purchase something that‚Äôs difficult to get. I want to get into the sellers good books. I feel a bottle would help the cause.

I feel something of ¬£120 (max) would be enough, but I have absolutely zero knowledge on whiskey. I saw a bottle that was Suntory Yamazaki Whisky 12 Year Old 70cl which seemed nice.

I think a Japanese one would be cool vs Scottish.

ArcticGiant,8two3j,5,whiskey,Advice on hosting a whisk(e)y tasting for my newbie friends.,"I am planning on hosting a whisk(e)y tasting to introduce my unenlightened friends to the world of whisk(e)y. I want to provide a range of flavors from different whisk(e)y varieties:

1. A lighter, Lowland or Speyside Scotch.
2. A Bourbon
3. A Rye
4. A smoky, peaty Islay or Highland Scotch

Each of these choices, I want to highlight a different facet of what whisk(e)y is, but also be representative of the ""standard/idea"" of its respective style.

Also, because I'm introducing this to new people, I want them to be something that they could justify purchasing, if it is in their liking, so nothing too expensive, but not so cheap that it isn't worth sipping.

Any suggestions as to how I could add to/modify my list, or specific recommendations are welcomed. Thanks in advance.",8,2018-06-26 11:14:16

jhenrys1993,8u5vqh,33,whiskey,Visiting a larger city with better distribution; have $400-$500 to stock up on what I can‚Äôt get at home,"I live in a suburb of a mid size Midwestern city, and this weekend I am visiting a much larger Midwestern city with a much broader variety of whiskeys available.  I plan to spend $400 ($500 is a hard max) to buy some bottles that can‚Äôt be had where I live.

For context, my current collection is as follows:
- Green Spot
- Highland Park 18
- Hakushu 12
- Talisker Distiller‚Äôs Edition 
- Aberlour 12 Double Cask
- Glenmorangie 18

I have enjoyed all of these except the Aberlour, and I have a current list of whiskeys under consider for purchase:

The first is the Midleton Dair Ghaelach Bluebell, which would eat up over half of my budget at $260. However, I have tasted the previous version ‚ÄúGrinsell‚Äôs Wood, Tree 8‚Äù, and it was fantastic - I mean, ‚ÄúI should buy a bottle of this over anything else in my budget‚Äù good.  The alternative is the standard Midleton for $100 less. 

Next is Hibiki Harmony, which I tasted and once gave a bottle to friend, but have never owned. This feels like a no-brainer at $70.

Two days ago, I tried the Yamazaki 12 for the very first time, and I really, really enjoyed it. It‚Äôs getting harder to find, and I know I can get a bottle for $100 where I‚Äôll be. 

I want to try something from Nikka, but I am unsure what to try. I read a muted review of the Miagikyo. Any suggestions? The Yoichi perhaps for $80? 

I was considering one of the Glenmorangie limited editions, since I quite like the 18, however none have truly caught my attention. The only other Glenmorangie I‚Äôve had was the Lasanta, which did not impress me. 

I invite any other suggestions on how to allocate. I know the Japanese whiskeys are ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù at the moment, but I do genuinely enjoy them and I feel the desire to buy them while I can. The Midleton seems like proper special treat, but means foregoing other bottles. Of course, if I missed anything you view as a no-brainer, please comment below with other suggestions.  

Rarely do I splurge like this, but this is an annual opportunity at best and I would like to make it count.

Thank you r/whiskey
Cheers

Problem is, I seem to be all over the place.  I would like to go with something that appeals to my profile but from different brands/distilleries/regions, as I stick to the same so often.

The following is what I have had before in my cabinet at one point or another.

Bushmills 21
Glenlivet 18
Glenlivet Naddura 16 
Highland Park 12
Redbreast 12
Knappogue 12
Gentleman Jack Single Barrel
Bushmills Black Bush
Glenlivet 12
Crown Royal
Gentleman Jack
Knob Creek
Knob Creek Rye
Templeton Rye
Johnie Walker Black

Bushmills 21 remains my favorite at the moment and I will most likely get another bottle along with Hibiki which I recently tried, and am set to find a bottle.

Based on the profile, I would like to hear some suggestions of 2-3 bottles that aren't obscenely pricey for the taste.  To elaborate, I recently tried Balvenie 21 and liked it, but not at the price point. I found Middletons to be underwhelming for the price as well and just not very memorable.

GradStud22,8knvvz,6,whiskey,Canadian Club Classic (12 Years) vs. Canadian Club Premium (6 Years). Thoughts?,"Hey,

Sorry for my ignorance; I'm pretty late (and thus new) to whisky.  A few months ago, I found myself really enjoying Canadian Club Classic. I see that Canadian Club Premium is a tiny bit cheaper. 

A part of me is tempted to say that the tiny increase in price is more than worth the additional 6 years difference but I also hate the idea of not trying new things (i.e., I hope I'm not unfairly disparaging the cheaper one on the basis of the fact that its marginally cheaper). 

Thus, I ask of you seasoned whisky drinkers: Do you have thoughts on the matter? I'll probably go buy one of them in a few moments.

After running through a few event calculators, it seems like we will need ~23 bottles of liquor (in addition to the beer/wine). I'd like 3 - 4 of those bottles to be whiskey.

My preference is to not have any whiskey made from corn (allergy). Though I've never had a serious reaction from the whiskey's Ive had--other stuff definitely.

I usual stick with Scotch...though I've had a fair amount of Jameson too. I enjoy a variety, but I'd like to be able to kiss my wife during day/night and she says Lagavulin reminds her of surgical fluid...so too smoky is off the menu.

I'm open to other options though.

blackc0ffee,8mvol2,5,whiskey,Appreciation for Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Scottish Barley Heavily Peated,"Yesterday my town, Ellicott City, experienced a horrendous flood that wiped out a large portion of our little city. Having lost everything in a flood here two years prior, I was a bit antsy as the rain began to come down harder and the river waters behind my home rose ever so slightly. I poured myself a glass of the title whisky and stood on my porch watching bedlam around me. As the sidewalk beside my home buckled and slid into the river I delighted in the sweet yet salty smoke of the whisky's nose. While a Jeep washed down the road in front of my eyes i found my tongue met with an initial explosion of caramel and vanilla. When the water crested over my deck toward the front door a few rain drops fell into my glass. The hydration of impending doom opened up the palate to expose a divine smokiness and a touch of lemon. Indeed, as the emergency evacuation services dragged me over the roofs to safety I could still taste the warm peat throughout my mouth. So here's to you Bruichladdich. Thank you for the liquid courage to stay calm, cool, and collected through this ordeal. When, if ever, I am allowed to return to my home I eagerly await finishing the half glass sitting on my table.

Incandescent_Man,8d7mul,6,whiskey,Alternatives to Japanese Whiskey,"Japanese whiskey is in very limited supply yet immensely popular thus it's price is extremely high. I see all the time on this sub comments such as, ""That Japanese whiskey is nice, but not worth $100. You would be better off with a $60 bottle of scotch"". Yet I never see anyone say which scotch. I'd like to change that.

The reason, I believe, that Japanese whiskey is popular is because, contrary to popular opinion, **it is different**  that most other whiskies. Japanese whiskeys tend to be complex, yet subtle. They are gentile and friendly, but somehow not boring. In my experience there are very few whiskies outside of Japan that accomplish this. However, I am in no way an expert or have tried enough whiskey to know this is 100% true. So, I would like to compile a list of alternatives to specific popular Japanese whiskey.

Now I'm not looking for alternatives that are 50% there, or 60% there, or even 80% there; I'm looking for true doppelgangers, alternatives that are so close you'd have a hard time telling the difference in a blind taste.

My current list of Japanese whiskeys that I would like to find doppelgangers for: 

* Hakushu - There are definitely some scotches that offer that subtle peat smoke behind a fruit forward palate. Things like Talisker, Highland Park, Caol Ila Unpeated, or Bruichladdich unpeated, but none of those are as gentile and friendly as the Hakushu and none have that same green apple brightness.

* Nikka Yoichi - A subtle yet rich peatiness backed by a subtle maritime brine flavor. There's a sort of fruity velvety thing going on too, melon maybe? Anyway the closest I've found is Talisker 10, but that is much more aggressive than the Yoichi and lacks that fruity velvety smoothness.

* Yamazaki - I'm not as familiar with this one, but from my limited experience I would describe it as floral and honey with a bit of vanilla and peach. I imagine this one would be easy to find an alternative for. Glenfidich? Balvenie Single Barrel First Fill? Or maybe even an Irish like Teeling or Yellow Spot?

* Hibiki - Never had it. Would love to hear ya'lls thoughts.

There are so many more, but these seem to be the most popular so I'll just start with those.

Please feel free to add some you might know about.

Thanks

My thinking in getting a sample set is that there might be something in there he likes or may not have had the chance to try. Hopefully.

If there's a better sample set available in the UK that I should really go for instead, please do let me know. Also, if I - in some way - just made a complete arse of myself do feel free to point, laugh and otherwise ridicule me.

Weasel_Cannon,8ehv01,6,whiskey,Aberfeldy 12 tasting notes,"I was gifted a bottle of this at my ‚Äúman-baby shower‚Äù last year and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I‚Äôve since learned a lot about whiskeys, and thought I‚Äôd give you all my quick review of this whiskey.

Nose: strong fruit scent, bananas along with peaches and cream, then into a smooth caramely orange skin with cinnamon. It smells like a smoked Old Fashioned. The oak is firm but overpowered by fruit and honeysuckle.

Taste (neat): like a spicy butterscotch pudding. It‚Äôs thick in the mouth, and it‚Äôs sweet. The oak is more present now, but it‚Äôs very well rounded. Like toffee mixed with espresso then *almost* burnt. More spice, white and pink peppercorns, and figs. The smokiness isn‚Äôt really announced until the finish, then it sets in like a nice cigar. Smooth, rich, Smokey and it almost makes your tongue tingle. 

Overall: I‚Äôm glad I bought this bottle again, it‚Äôs as good as I remember and for the price it‚Äôs full of flavor and complexity. 8.75/10

Now, I'm curious as to how I should approach everything whiskey related as a newbie. What should I drink, what should I avoid, what's the best place to learn all the terminology/information on whiskey? Right now I'm on a mission to try all the different kinds like Bourbon (check), Scotch (Check), Canadian, Japanese, and Irish.

Pour bourbon over dry ingredients and let steep 8-10 minutes (or longer if you wish to extract more bitter flavors). 

Serve neat.

Trevor266,869did,8,whiskey,Hakushu 12 Live Review,"After quite a bit of looking, I was at a big box store (HyVee) and saw a row of Hakushu 12 to my surprise, and for a shockingly low $77.00, I had to pick it up, since all of our liquor stores were out with no idea when they would get getting more. So I'm popping this bad boy open, and sharing what I taste as I go along. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Drank - Neat in a Glencairn glass, allowed to rest for 5 minutes

Color - Very pale yellow, extremely similar to Toki.

Nose - Smells exactly like Glenfiddich 12 mixed with Toki to me, very bright, floral notes, citrus peel, honey, green apple, and if you really dig your nose into the glass you'll get the faintest hint of peat. Overall this is a really, really pretty nose. Again, imagine Glenfiddich 12 and Toki mixed, but much more refined. To be honest, when I first smelled this after opening it I was really, really disappointed. I was so afraid that I had just paid 80 bucks for Glenfiddich 12, and it's not that the nose is bad, it's really nice actually, it's just not anything unique, certainly not an $80 nose.

Palette - Initially, this whisky is extremely bright and sweet, from the subtle peat on the nose and the 43% abv, I wasn't expecting it to be so sweet up front, it's incredibly floral, beautiful and smooth with almost no burn whatsoever, as it reaches the back of your mouth the complexity of this whisky really shines, you get these really deep grassy and pine notes which I thought would be odd, but it is absolutely beautiful and refreshing, one of the nicest flavor profiles I've had in a whisk(e)y. According to the tasters notes on Suntory's website, they say Mint and Kiwi on the palette, which upon looking for those notes, you absolutely do get both of them right at the end as the grassy notes die down, but not before the finish. They also say pear, but I'm not sure I get that on this whisky, I do on the nose, not so much the palette. The kiwi for those who may have a hard time finding it, is really more like the bitter notes of kiwi seeds, rather than the meat of the kiwi, it's much more subtle in my opinion.

Finish - Rich, slightly peaty, mint and kiwi persist from palette to finish on this one, with pine needle intermingling pretty intensely, there's also some subtle peppery notes at the very end of the finish. The finish on this one for me is extremely long, the richness of the oils on this whisky coat your tongue and don't leave for quite some time, I'm 30 seconds into this finish and only just noticing the flavors going away.

Overall - This is a whisky that comes from the forest, and I don't think you could come to any other conclusion upon drinking it. It's beautifully complex, nuanced, subtle, truly a beautiful, beautiful whisky, and it really does capture the environment of the distillery it was made at. To be clear, I'm not some Japanese whisky fanboy (I think Toki is average at best and it sort of makes me sick from the sweetness and spiciness of it, I think you can get better scotches for less than Nikka, etc.), but this whisky I truly believe has some interesting and worthwhile complexity to it to justify the price tag. Would I pay the ridiculous $90-150 I've seen online for it? No chance, would I pay the $80 I paid for it? You bet, for that price, I think this is an absolutely wonderful whisky. I do think the nose on this one is a little boring due to the fact I've had plenty of single malt scotch with nearly identical noses for half the price, but the palette and the finish are where this whisky really shines. Should you go buy it? That's up to you, there's plenty of good whisk(e)y you can get at this price point that isn't this whisky, but if you like Japanese whisky, I can absolutely promise you this one isn't going to disappoint.

My rating - 85/100, worth the money for me.",1,2018-03-22 14:12:07

Nisstrx,86hd0v,3,whiskey,Tasting notes for auld stag Egyptian whiskey,"The thing to know about this whiskey is that each bottle/batch is slightly different. The taste and character even changes depending on how much time passed on production and how much time the bottle spent open. 
It has nothing special but when it is new it is very strong and even jumps to your eyes. It has some oak and sometimes smokiness and a faint hint of caramel. I don't have a lot of experience with whiskey but it becomes smoother with time ( time since production and since the bottle has been opened) then the caramel becomes easier to notice. Given the price it is the best and for me the only thing affordable. It costs 150 EGPs which is around $8.51. other better imported brands here cost way more than $85 due to taxation. It is hard to make whiskey in a mostly Muslim country were you may be killed for selling alcohol. Let's say I love whiskey too much to risk being spotted buying it even if it is the only affordable Egyptian brand that doesn't taste all that good. 
I hope you all get a chance to try it. It is always an adventure because you don't know what you are gonna get. Still it has become much much better compared to the reviews I read online.

opensorceress,86r1qt,3,whiskey,I began drinking via Ardbeg Uigeadail a few months ago. Everything I've tried since seems boring by comparison. Please help!,"Hello, everyone!

As per the title, I'm a woman who never drank up until very recently. I fell in love with it though after enjoying some Ardbeg Uigeadail. The smoke, the sweetness, the fact that it seems to change every few seconds‚Äîit's amazing!

Unfortunately, I'm not really sure where to go from here. I've tried some standard peated Islay whiskies (e.g. Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10, Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Scottish Barley, Lagavulin 16), and while they're nice enough, I find them a bit boring compared to the Uigeadail‚Äîespecially the Port Charlotte and the Lagavulin. I've also had a couple unpeated whiskies like Bruichladdich's Classic Laddie and Islay Barley, but I find them even less interesting than the most tame of the peated malts. On a totally different track, Angel's Envy was sort of nice in that ""I'm drinking liquid bubble gum"" kind of way, but it was nowhere near as fun as the Uigeadail. Finally, everything else I've tried‚Äîespecially anything I've had described to me as ""smooth""‚Äîhas been a total waste of time. :(

I am desperate and open to pretty much anything here! Another peated scotch to knock me on my butt would be great. (Maybe an Octomore or a Kilchoman?) Something entirely different could be great too so long as it's sufficiently complex and challenging. (Balcones, perhaps? Corsair?) Take me to the most extreme of whiskey places, please! 

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated! Thank you so much!",25,2018-03-24 13:09:12

I tend to buy/try whiskeys that are suggested to me but I don't seem to have a very refined palate because I can never really figure out what the differences are between many types of whiskeys. 

How have others found their favorite drinks or types or brands of whiskeys? Is it simply to keep trying new things? Or is there a better way to define what my taste is?

Many thanks",7,2018-02-22 18:27:43

My Wife and I LOVE Four Roses: Single Barrel. I mean we drink a 750ml bottle in a matter of 2 days between the two of us... It's just super tasty, perfect with an ice cube, doesn't give you a hangover, its just beautiful.

So, why am I posting this?
Well, as much as my Wife and I love this bourbon, it's expensive! Avg about $50 a bottle.

Does anyone know of anything similar to Four Roses?
Cheaper alternative?

Or even just something similar to Four Roses? (I also want to branch out a little bit, similar pricing is fine...less than $100 of course).

Thanks in advanced you guys!

I am a law student and I want to get myself a premium bottle of hooch to crack open upon completion of my first year. I started my love affair with Aqua Vie in Scotland. I love the the general smoky character of Talisker and the Islay scotches. Also a big fan of Monkey Shoulder for blended. I‚Äôve been delving more into the realm of bourbon to both broaden my horizons save money. I‚Äôve found the bourbon price point to be much more accommodating, and like the different flavor profiles available at much lower price points. Buffalo Trace, Evan Williams BIB, Makers, Bim Jeam, etc. good bourbons at a lower price point. 

Which brings me to my main point. I‚Äôm in love with two liquors, and I can‚Äôt choose. Wanna treat myself and both these whiskies are a similar price point in my area (OR).

Is there anything you'd recommend mixing with it? Or would that be a ""waste"" so to speak? Really want to try to appreciate it as the person who gave it to me really swears by it.

Or at the very least with a few ice cubes.

That's not the point though. I have absolutely no sense of smell, and haven't for my whole life. I can still taste, but I can't smell/identify smells/etc. I'm just curious as to if I'm missing out a lot since I have no sense of smell?

Incandescent_Man,7siiws,0,whiskey,Story Time: Excited To Share The World Of Whisky With My Friend I Find An Old Dusty Bottle,"Was drinking with a friend who I had recently gifted a bottle of Monkey Shoulder to, his first Scotch, and when we finished the bottle I got the wild idea that I needed to go get another bottle of Scotch right then. I found the only sober person at the party and asked them to drive me to the nearest liquor store. 

I wanted to get something smokey and interesting since we were just discussing how varied and interesting Scotch can be; we just finished drinking a nice, sweet friendly Speyside blend so now I wanted a mean, in-your-face, smokey Islay. The first liquor store we went to had 4 tweakers inside and nothing but boring blended Scotch. Weak sauce! So I convinced my driver to try another place down the road; this wasn't my neighborhood and I was just searching Google Maps and hoping for the best. 

The next liquor store was more promising. First of all there weren't any tweakers inside or outside and they had some single malts, but they were all Highlands and Speysides. I asked the clerk if they had any Islay Single Malts and he looked at me like I was speaking another language. I said, ""You know like really smokey; Lagavulin is a popular one"". Still all I got was a blank stare like I was some sort of alien. As I'm standing there debating whether I should just get one of the bottles he had or risk asking my friend to go on an even longer ridiculous trip to find Scotch the clerk says to me, ""Oh actually I think we have some other Scotch over here."" He leads me into a dark corner in the back of his store and lo and behold he did have a few other single malts sitting on a dusty shelf, but still no Islay. Goddammit. And then I saw it hiding on a lower shelf all covered in dust and [in a box I didn't recognize, ""Highland Park 12""](https://i.imgur.com/pLYIZnG.png). I thought to myself, ""Well Jay (my driver) isn't going to want to go to another store.  Highland Park not an Islay, but its an Island and kinda smokey. This is the best you're going to get."". I grabbed the box and headed to the counter. I asked the clerk, ""I don't recognize this label. How long has this been on your shelf?"". He just shrugged his shoulders. I opened the box to make sure it contained the HP12 and it hadn't all evaporated. I handed it over to the clerk and he then busts out this hand duster and proceeds to dust off the box and bottle; I had never seen that in my life, though I did appreciate the service. I finished the purchase and got into the car and told my friend what I just went through.

When I got back to the party I didn't tell anyone that the bottle was old and dusty thinking it may influence their thoughts on it once we tasted it. And then it happened. As I was opening up the bottle, removing the seal and removing the cork, the cork breaks. Ah hell. I say, ""Well this bottle was probably sitting on that guys shelf for 15 years"" and then proceeded to tell my friend the story of the multiple liquor stores and the clerk with the duster. I managed to get the broken half that was stuck in the bottle out and poured a couple of glasses. As far as I could tell the whisky was perfectly fine. My friend wasn't over the moon about the Scotch and the whole thing was more effort than it was worth, but I guess I got a story out of it right?

So yea cool story bro, but there is another reason I posted this here. Two questions:

1. Does anyone know what years Highland Park 12 used this label: https://i.imgur.com/pLYIZnG.png ?

And

2. Is there any chance the whisky was ""less than optimal"" considering the condition of the cork? I mean this thing absolutely disintegrated. I was kinda drunk so I didn't trust my taste buds at the time. I mean there was nothing rotten or sour about it and it was good enough that I had several drams of it, but I still wonder if it may have lost a little of its punch somehow.

Ok thanks for reading if you got this far and thanks to anyone who may have answers to my questions.

I tried a couple different drinks but didn't like alcohol much, until I found whiskey. I absolutely love it. I love the taste, the history, the process. 

Usually when I get into a new 'hobby' I get really obsessed with it for a while, until the initial excitement evidently fades. I still enjoy the hobby afterward, but I don't think about it as much. 

I'm still in that ""excited"" phase of whiskey, and I've been drinking roughly 5oz each day. Three 750ml bottles in the past two weeks. Now, I didn't think that was very much, it doesn't feel like much at all, I honesty can't say I've ever been drunk off whiskey before. I feel like I'm hardly drinking any at all to be honest (such a small amount of liquid). I find myself wanting to drink more because I love the taste, especially when I get a new bottle.

KobiGirreven,7lsmij,2,whiskey,My Scotch journey so far. (with questions),"Preface:  Only been drinking Whiskey for about a month and a half.  Been very into bourbon and rye, but trying to push into scotch.



First, I picked up a bottle of Monkey Shoulder, which i like quite a bit!  Decided I wanted to try something else to get some variety.  Kept seeing people talk about Highland Park 12.  Read some reviews and was expecting fruity, caramel, slight smoke.   Bought a bottle and all I really taste is Iodine and STRONG peat smoke... Pretty caught off guard since i was reading ""slight peat"" most places.  Having trouble pouring another glass.

So then i figured I needed to taste some stuff before buying another full bottle.  Found small bottles (50ml - 100ml) of Macallan 12, Glenlivet 12, and the Glenmorangie sample pack.  So far i've really enjoyed the Macallan 12 and the Glenmorangie 10, but the Glenmorangie 12 was a little peaty for me (less than the Highland Park 12, but still kinda strong for my taste).

Decided maybe I need to find a better gateway into the peaty/smokey scotch.  Been enjoying the High West whiskeys, so I picked up their Campfire blend (Rye/Bourbon/Scotch).  The peat comes through pretty heavy to me.  Get the rye spice and bourbon caramel sweetness, but the smoke still seems uneven.

So seems maybe I am just a little sensitive to peat.  Sorry for my rambling post, but just looking for some general insight into how others got into scotch and their take on the peaty/smokiness of the whiskeys stated above.",13,2017-12-24 10:10:54

prayformoj0,7ejyw4,2,whiskey,Bringing home A bottle of whiskey for holidays to non-whiskey drinkers,"Hey all,

So in an effort to not make this a wasteful ""recommendation"" post, I wanted to provide the info that r/whiskey says to provide for posts like this. 

I enjoy whiskey but have mostly had the well known, not particularly exciting stuff. (Jack, Jim, Bulleit, Makers, etc) but have been getting more and more curious about it on a deeper level. However for all intents and purposes I am new to the whiskey world. 

So with that said I wanted to bring a bottle home for Thanksgiving to share with family -- none of whom are regular whiskey drinkers themselves, though I know a number of them, mainly my brothers, enjoy whiskey. 

Here's what I am aiming for...

Budget: $40 - $80
Which whiskeys have I enjoyed in the past? -- I like whiskies on the smoother side with some sweetness, though not overly sweet. I like a good mix of sweet and oakey -- hints of cinnamon, rye and other more balancing flavors are nice with a natural sweetness. But I like a smooth, easy finish with body and character. I do not want to bring home anything smokey. I will increase my smoke game in due time, but right now I'm looking for something a little more pleasing to a novice crowd. 
Which bottles am I considering? Was looking at mainly American since they seem to offer more in the way of the semi-sweet, smooth characteristics I'm looking for though I'm open. Dickel barrel select, Four Roses Private were a couple examples. I also need something readily available from BevMo or stores like that. 
I'll be in San Jose, CA when I buy the bottle. 
I realize the best way to do this is to go to a proper whiskey bar and try some out. Unfortunately I waited last minute, and now I'm just trying to get some thoughts from other people.

Hopefully I supplied enough info to get some thoughts, much appreciated!  ",11,2017-11-22 02:28:30

Have any of y'all gone to a tasting class? Is it a worthwhile experience? How did  you find it? And for extra points: do you have any suggestions for whiskey tasting bars in Philadelphia or Souther Connecticut? I'd love to take my father to something like this as a Christmas gift.

-A bottle of mid shelf whiskey- like Jamesons or Dewars

-Three to four sticks of cinnamon 

-Tablespoon of honey

-One jalape√±o (optional)

Open up the bottle of whiskey. Pour yourself two fingers to make room in the bottle.

Add all the ingredients and replace the lid securely.

Let the bottle sit unopened until the week of Christmas. During this waiting time, every couple of days, hold the bottle upside down until the cinnamon and honey fall down to the mouth of the bottle. Once this happens, turn the bottle right side up.

When the week of Christmas comes, open and enjoy neat.",0,2017-11-24 16:50:36
ZenMechanist,7f6ric,23,whiskey,Has anyone else noticed this whiskey marketing ploy?,"While on a distillery tour in Scotland the tour guide was trying to convince the group that the market for aged whiskey was an element of ‚Äúsnobbery‚Äù that her company was trying to dissuade. She made the point of asking rhetorically who amongst us could tell the age of a whiskey in a blind taste test or which of us would be able to distinguish the older of two whiskeys in a blind taste test.

While she was undoubtedly correct for the majority of casual whiskey drinkers (myself included) I felt that her motive was more along the lines of marketing younger whiskey to increase turnover of the product. She made the point of mentioning that they lose approximately 2% of whiskey by volume per year that it sits in the barrels. This means that the older a whiskey is the more has gone to the ‚Äúangels share‚Äù and the more time they have had to pay for storage. They produce a lot of whiskey and by convincing the market that young is just as good as old they can sell a lot more a lot sooner, paying less in storage cost along the way.

Has anyone else come across this ploy? What are your thoughts?",52,2017-11-24 18:54:07

Here's how it works: just add in each row of the table the name of your spirit and how many oz are added to the bottle. It will calculate the ratio of each spirit. When you're ready to have a taste, enter the amount of your pour in the pour box and click the pour button. The sheet will subtract the volume of the pour from each spirit based on the percentage of the total volume it makes up. Hope someone gets some use out of this. I tested it pretty thoroughly, I think, so let me know if you notice any issues.

Petya_Lazarova,7ftwcz,4,whiskey,Smokey scotch - help needed... Please!,"Hi there! 

My partner in crime, uhm I mean in life, is a whiskey lover. More precisely he prefers scotch.

Occasionally I like to surprise him with a bottle of his favourite amber-coloured drink, but I find it a bit difficult as I myself am not that into whiskeys.

The last one I bought for him was the 16 y.o. Lagavulin, which he hasn't tried till then and he loved. He liked also the Laphroaig (I'm not sure if it was the 10 y.o. or the QC or both), but says it wasn't that impressive as the Lagavulin. The others he likes are single malt ones.

So... I want to surprise him again with something smokey and I have a problem deciding with what and I hope you'd help me with that.

I'm debating if I should take him Lagavulin again, as he obviously liked it a lot, or should I go for something that he hasn't tried yet. About the second option I'm not sure which one to choose - Talisker (10 or Storm),  Highland Park 12, Bowmore 12, Caol Ila 12, Oban 14, The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 or something other in the same price range. Ardbeg is out of the list intentionally.

Please do tell me which one of those you found more interesting/different/imperssive and why?
What would you prefer to receive as a gift - something new to try or something you know you like?


Huge thanks in advance! :-)

2.  The workbook also says bourbon can not have coloring added.  From what I can decipher in the CFR it's only straight bourbon that forbids additional coloring.  Is non-straight bourbon allowed?

3.  Under Bottled-in-Bond's definition is ""must be aged in a federally bonded warehouse under government supervision"".  Can we assume that's no longer the case, or are there still feds that poke around all of those rackhouses?

bartenders_choice,7g7kg5,0,whiskey,Would Anyone be interested in an at home whiskey tasting class?,"Hey all, new to the community here. I am a bartender in Nashville. I am beginning stages of designing a company that would do spirit tasting classes, lead by bartenders that really know their stuff and have spent time in distilleries and learning from the people that make these products. We would most likely start with whiskey/bourbon, and then branch into other spirits as interest grows. Initially classes would be lead in home, AKA we come to you and throw a whiskey party at your house, or you go to a friends house and attend a party.

My current idea would be to taste 6-9 products, at a 1oz pour for each (because I've been to tastings where you just get a little finger of everything, and nobody's got time for that). Your bartender/teacher would not only walk you through each of the products, but the history of the spirit itself, tips for what to look for when tasting and how to taste properly, and some of the history and distinctions of each product we taste through. In my research I haven't been able to find any companies that provide this kind of experience in a small, intimate setting, where you're really just chatting with someone who's worked behind a bar and has a lot of expertise.

I joined the community to begin gauging interest in this type of service, as I believe there is a national market that could be expanded into if our model is successful. So if there were a service like that, where you could buy a ticket to go to a whiskey(or other spirit) tasting at a friends place, get to drink a lot of really great whiskey and learn a ton in the process, as well as come away with recommendations for how to shop/look for products on your own, is that something anyone would be interested in? And if so, how much would you pay for an individual ticket to something like that? Any help/feedback I can get at this stage in the startup would be super great.

janeyjaneybobaney,7gi4m9,4,whiskey,Smokey / peaty starter scotches,"At present, I definitely prefer cleaner tasting scotches, things that are very smooth and fruity are right up my alley I.e.  Glenfiddich 12/15, Glenlivet 12/15, Glenmorangie, Dalwhinnie, and that sort of thing are my usual go to.  I've been feeling lately that I need to at least to try to diversify my tastes a bit.  Tried some bourbons, Irish whiskeys, and different straight ryes as well.  I just can't seem to break through on things that are smokey or peaty or other stronger flavours I.e. Islay scotches.  Even I notice with the bottle of Oban 14 I have that I just get all the smoke when I drink it.  


Any recommendations on scotches that have smokey / peaty / other flavours that might be a ""gateway"" to opening up my palate?  Any other directions I should consider other than islay type scotches?  ",26,2017-11-30 08:23:21

Someone gave me a decent one to try about a month ago and since then I have been enamored with whiskey and trying to find out all about it.

So far ive bought a bottle of Monkey Shoulder ($90), Buffalo Trace ($50) and Woodworth Reserve ($50)   I live in Canada so prices are higher than they would be in the US.  They have all been great.

Anyway,  I have a co-worker who is going to the States next week and he said he would pick me up a bottle of whiskey while there (going to Arizona).  I said I would give him $50 USD to buy me a bottle there.

What would be a good choice?  What can I get for $50 American that one of you can recommend?   Best bang for the buck!

MangyMoose76,78joj6,2,whiskey,Basil Hayden Dark Rye,"http://abc.nc.gov/uploads/packages/13609.jpg

Seems to be a blend of American rye, Canadian rye, and port.

I haven't looked into this much, so I've no idea how long the ryes were in barrel.  I have no idea what port was used.  I'm sure it was not vintage.   

But, I picked this up the other day on a whim.  I opened it to it, and the typical spicy nose from the bottle (relative to other ryes) was definitely lacking in my opinion. 

Poured a dram, and dropped in one small cube as is typical for me.  This is a lot sweeter due to the port.  In fact, I think the port takes away a lot from what could be a decent blended product.  That's not to say this is a bad pour.  In fact, the sweetness makes it somewhat ideal for an after-dinner drink.  But, I do miss the spiciness - that great bite you get from a great rye.  

This will last me a while.  I hope others enjoy it.  ",3,2017-10-25 07:16:51

highcuu,794fjh,3,whiskey,Looking for a flask,"Hello all. I am currently searching for a flask to give as a gift and would appreciate some input as I have never personally used one. 

First question...material. I was leaning toward titanium for both aesthetics and performance. I have heard that it does not impart any metallic flavor to its contents. Is this a reasonable concern? The intention would be for storing whiskey at most a few days to a week. I also intend to have it engraved, so that would affect the material as well. 

The issue that I have found in searching titanium flasks is that all but two (made by One Tigris and Combo) I've found have a loose cap. This being for hiking, skiing, etc. I would be worried about losing the cap...or dropping it with gloves on. 

The issue I have with the one Tigris flask is the weight. It is almost 3 times as heavy as comparably sized alternates (it weighs. And, Combo decided to put their logo right in the middle of the convex side...which is where I'd want to engrave.

While I‚Äôm mostly interested in cocktails, I‚Äôm also keen on enjoying whiskey neat. 


I just did a sample of two my recent favorites: Evan Williams 1783 and Buffalo Trace. I‚Äôm not going to pretend to know the proper terms for the flavors or tasting experience, but I‚Äôm confused on something and I was hoping someone could shed some light. From what I can tell, Buffalo Trace is a ‚Äúnicer‚Äù whiskey than the 1783 all things considered. I was surprised to find that the 1783 went down way easier. Now I wasn‚Äôt taking it like a shot or anything, just a sip trying to focus on flavor. But the Buffalo Trace was... a lot compared to the Evan Williams. I was expecting the Buffalo Trace to be smoother (again I don‚Äôt know terms, my apologies) than the 1783 given the price point (I figured the cheaper bottle would be harsher). But I found quite the opposite. Anyone care to help a novice out? 


Edit: I guess I should point out, I found neither to be *bad*, I just found the Buffalo Trace much harsher while the 1783 was smoother/easier to drink. ",7,2017-09-28 09:18:10

So basically I want you to tell a story about the whiskey you're drinking. Do not use tasting notes or flavor wheels. Just create a landscape so vivid that you might transport the reader into a reality where they might imagine living what you're drinking.

Peaty smoke body, though a bit of malty sweetness in the palate which was a welcome contrast. Finish full of smoke, dried fruit, and oaky spice. Not for me, though I'm glad to have tried it. I suppose Islay fans should love this, as it's basically an archetypal peat monster. Personally if I want a smoky dram I'd prefer Laphroaig.",15,2017-10-02 07:49:47

saveadroptodrink,73umtc,3,whiskey,campfire notes,"I'm looking for a bottle of whisky that most likely resemble the flavors of a campfire. 

From my research it looks like the heavy hitters are Laphroaig 10 and Ardbeg 10. I'm new to whisky and don't have many options except buying a full bottle or going to the bars (which I personally don't enjoy). I read that the Laphroaig 10 is great, but I am quite worried about the medicinal flavor notes since I'm not a big fan of notes alike. 

How does the laphroaig 10 compare to laphroaig quarter cask? and fair with Ardbeg? It's getting quite cold here in the intermountain region and a bottle of campfire whisky is very appealing to me right now. 

I've tried

* Hibiki Harmony NAS
* Hakushu 12
* Nikka Coffey Grain
* Jameson
* Jack Daniel's
* other cheap bottles you'll find at college frat parties.

I personally loved Hakushu 12, which has some peat and lead me to seek out more heavily peated/smoked flavors in whisky. I also enjoy the smell of matches, firewood, and cigarettes. Thank you for your time, 

Opinions on?: 

* Lagavulin 16
* Talisker 10


**UPDATE**: I just got myself a bottle of Laphroaig Quarter Cask for $50 over the Lagavulin 16 ($95) and omg it's so good. I'm in love with the smokey-ness. Definitely, lingers a long time in your mouth and it's quite strong but man it's the flavour I've been looking for. Thanks for all your advice!

Dys-funk-shun-all,73vtgo,0,whiskey,Where to begin.,"Pretty much all of my adult life I have been waiting for this opportunity; to start a fine whiskey collection. I finally have reached the point where I have some income to save every month and so the time has come at last! I've had some pretty good tasting drinks here and there over the years but I'd like to make this an upward sloping trend. I've never been much of a fan of bourbon or Canadian, but I've really only sampled the ""well"" varieties of these, still, I'd rather start abroad and perhaps eventually work over to new world whiskeys. I absolutely love Irish, the floral and creamy sherry finished ones eapecially and I really like some Scotch as well, but I don't yet have the palate to be discerning in my choices. Yet.

I need a good ""starter"" Scotch and/or Irish reccomendation. World is acceptable too. I'm really only able to do $50-70 a bottle right now, hopefully that will increase with time. ",8,2017-10-03 05:19:04

I've studied up on NAS maturation and it would at least help me find the answer to the last sentence's problem, but it's all pretty expensive if i end up failing so thoroughly that I don't want to continue. I recently saw that poitin is available for sale (was actually singing ""The Real Old Mountain Dew"" and just happened to get curious about what pacheen was, took me awhile to find the spelling though) I was wondering if anyone here has both some experience with distilling and knowledge of whether poitin will give me the required tasting information to be able to start maturation with a little more confidence.

The price might be different now as it was the last one in stock from that retailer. It dropped from around ¬£125 to ¬£110 since the last time I looked. I panicked and bought it. 

Heard mixed reviews about it. Some people have really talked up Glenfarclas. Others have reviewed the 25yo online on different whiskey review sites and said great things. And then some people have been negative saying that they were underwhelmed for a 25yo.

mdrane,6x0c1k,11,whiskey,Distillery Roadtrip Review,"This is a copy of a blog post that I wrote. Click the link at the bottom to go to the post itself which has pictures and links to more detail on each distillery. I don't make money off of the review or the blog in general.

When I started planning my distillery drive, I didn‚Äôt find many lists that reviewed the distilleries as in-depth as I would have liked. So, I pieced together what I could find and decided that when I was done, I would write the review that I wished I had. This review will cover the ten distilleries (five on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail) that I visited over three days. Though I wasn‚Äôt able to hit them all, I hope this can be helpful for anyone else thinking about a similar trip. 

I‚Äôll include three sections. The first is an overview of the drive and some reflections on the trip overall. After that will be my own profile of each distillery. Finally, I‚Äôll include a few lists of top distilleries by category.

Also, probably obvious but I'm receiving no compensation from anyone for writing this up.

The Drive Overall

First, it‚Äôs important to point out that all of our visits were done on weekdays and many were early in the day. Most tour guides told us that crowds could get much larger on weekends so, if you‚Äôre trying to hit a lot of stops, go on weekdays if possible.

A regret along with not buying the Maker‚Äôs Mark, was not visiting Willett. It‚Äôs my favorite Rye and yet somehow, I forgot to plan it into our itinerary. Worst of all was that we drove right past it while we were in Bardstown visiting Barton‚Äôs and Heaven Hill. Guess I‚Äôll just have to go back and visit again.

I was disappointed that the distilleries didn‚Äôt give us more information to take with us from the tasting. Jack Daniels was the only one that had a paper with notes that I could take away. I understand that places need to get you through quick but more interactive tools would have helped me remember what I liked about each whiskey that I tried.

Some fun trends: Every tour in Kentucky told us about how they allow pictures everywhere on their tour with either a direct or an indirect statement that others don‚Äôt. Yet only Jack Daniel‚Äôs and George Dickel didn‚Äôt allow pictures at some points. Also, every tour guide had two names‚Ä¶

Now for the distilleries. I won‚Äôt get too into the qualities of the whiskeys themselves as it would take up a lot of space, I‚Äôm not a great taster, and my purpose was to try them, not rate them.

Barton‚Äôs 1792
300 Barton Rd. Bardstown, KY 40004
Highlight: The tour. My favorite tour of the whole trip.

Lowlight: The guard loudly, purposefully, waking my wife up when we pulled into the gate.

Tour (Bushel to Bottle): My favorite tour we went on. Being the only people on the tour may have given us more access/interaction than if we were in a big group. A lot of walking and stairs.

Tasting: One of my least favorites, but it was free. I forgot to write down which whiskeys we tasted but I wasn‚Äôt a big fan. The coffee and cream liquor was great though

Value: Free, no complaints there.           

Ambiance: Nothing beautiful but I enjoyed walking around the area and smelling the grains in the air.

Freebies: You get to take home a bung stamped with the date of your tour.
Visitor Center/Gift Shop: Standard. They had t-shirts, whiskey, candles, cups, coasters.

Definitely Go If: You want value and are most interested in how whiskey is made.

Definitely Avoid If: The tasting and/or seeing beautiful things is really important to you.

Heaven Hill Bourbon Heritage Center
1311 Gilkey Run Road Bardstown, KY 40004

Highlight: Focused tasting experience.

Lowlight: None

Tour: No tour, just tasting

Tasting (Connoisseur Experience): Pricey ($20) but you get what you pay for. I tasted five whiskeys, one of which was 25 years old and meant to show the group how age doesn‚Äôt always equal quality. Otherwise, I got what I wanted out of this stop: tasting quality whiskeys.

Value: A little on the pricey side. They were good whiskeys but $20 was steep for no tour.               

Ambiance: One of the best. The set-up in the tasting room was classy. The building and grounds are welcoming.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: Extensive gift shop with a nice educational area to read through at your own pace.

Freebies: Cardboard coaster and the glass from the tasting.

Definitely Go If: You really just want a tour with a side of mini-museum.

Definitely Avoid If: You only want a tour of a distillery.

Maker‚Äôs Mark 
3350 Burks Spring Rd, Loretto, KY 40037

Highlight: Beautiful Grounds

Lowlight: None

Tour: 1.5 hours total. The grounds are beautiful so that‚Äôs a plus. You don‚Äôt get to see as much of the actual process as at the other distilleries. You‚Äôll hear about it throughout the walk, though. A lot of walking but few steps.

Tasting: We got to taste five of their whiskeys: Unaged, Maker‚Äôs Mark, 46, Barrel Proof, and the Private Select Tasting Panel.

Value: For $12, I would say this was one of the best values. Decent tour and great tasting.            

Ambiance: I almost forgot I was at a distillery. Seemed more like a wedding venue.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: Standard gift shop at the end of the tour. You can dip your own bottle if you buy one there.

Freebies: A Maker‚Äôs Mark label‚Ä¶

Definitely Go If: You want to see something beautiful, learn a bit about whiskey, and have a good tasting.

Definitely Avoid If: You want to get up close with the distillation process.

Wild Turkey 
1417 Versailles Rd, Lawrenceburg, KY 40342
Highlight: View of the Kentucky River

Lowlight: None

Tour: A little under an hour. This was one of my least favorite. A bus drives you to the different locations and there wasn‚Äôt as much to see at each stop. Not much walking but a lot of steps.

Tasting: I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan but that‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm not a big fan of Wild Turkey. We tried Russel Single Barrel, Rare Breed Barrel Proof, Russel‚Äôs 6 Year Rye, and American Honey.

Value: Decent value for $10, if you‚Äôre a fan of Wild Turkey Whiskey.        

Ambiance: The distillery tour felt sterile and corporate. The visitor center is relaxed.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: The visitor center and gift shop have a great view of the Kentucky River. I stood by the fence for a while after my tour and thought about all the great whiskeys that I had tasted throughout the day.

Freebies: A large Wild Turkey glass

Definitely Go If: You really want a Wild Turkey tasting and glass.

Definitely Avoid If: You have other distillery tours that you‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt care much about the tasting.

Buffalo Trace
113 Great Buffalo Trace, Frankfort, KY 40601

Highlight: Freddie, our tour guide.

Lowlight: None

Tour (Trace Tour): A little under an hour and a half. For the sake of our schedule, we did the most basic Trace Tour. We also didn‚Äôt need the whole behind-the-scenes deal since we were seeing so many other distilleries. Nevertheless, we got some unique information that we didn‚Äôt hear on any other tour. And our tour guide, Freddie, was by far the highlight. A decent amount of walking but no steps on this tour until the end (where there‚Äôs an elevator).

Tasting: Like Barton‚Äôs (who is also owned by Sazerac), this wasn‚Äôt the most extensive tasting, but it was free. Buffalo Trace might be my favorite bottom-shelf whiskey. Eagle Rare and the chocolate liquor were both good too.

Value: Free. Excellent value. I‚Äôd go again for one of the other tours for sure.                                     

Ambiance: This was in the top three for me alongside Maker‚Äôs Mark and Woodford Reserve. I liked getting to walk around before our tour started. The buildings have a nice old yet well-maintained feel to them.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: Essentially just a large gift shop. They had some selections here that I didn‚Äôt see anywhere else, though.

Freebies: Tour and tasting.

Definitely Go If: You want a free tour and decent tasting along with a walk around an appealing distillery.

Definitely Avoid If: You really care about the tasting.


Woodford Reserve
7855 McCracken Pike, Versailles, KY 40383

Highlight: Unique architecture.

Lowlight: You can only walk around the actual distillery on the tour. I would have loved more time for pictures afterwards.

Tour (Distillery Tour): Tour took an hour and fifteen minutes. Even if you‚Äôre seeing multiple distilleries, I‚Äôd recommend Woodford Reserve for its uniqueness. The stonework is impressive and there‚Äôs no other distillery like it. The wooden fermentation cylinders are rustic and we got to try some of the mash from one. Finally, the pot stills are pieces of art in themselves. They were the only ones I saw throughout the whole drive. It made me want to make plans for an Ireland/Scotland trip (though I hear the Irish distilleries aren‚Äôt much to see?). There was some walking and stairs, though an elevator was provided.

Tasting: This was one of the worst values, especially with the $14 price tag. While I love 

Distiller‚Äôs Select and Double Oaked, I expected more for what I paid, compared to other tours and tastings. I hear good things about their new rye whiskey and would have loved to sample it.

Value: Mediocre. I‚Äôm glad I took the tour but with the limited tasting and $14 cost, I doubt I would go back again.        

Ambiance: Beautiful. Even the drive up to the distillery is appealing. They‚Äôre going for the la-ti-da market and they succeed.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: This is the fancy gift shop. If you‚Äôre looking for a whiskey bow tie or overpriced (more than others) glass, this is the place to get it.

Freebies: None.

Definitely Go If: You want to see something unique.

Definitely Avoid If: You want value and don‚Äôt care about uniqueness.

Four Roses 
1224 Bonds Mill Rd, Lawrenceburg, KY 40342

Highlight: None

Lowlight: None

Tour: I only did the tasting at Four Roses. We were short on time and the tour was limited by construction so I figured this was the one to skip.

Tasting: Decent tasting. $5. I got to try their Yellow Label, Small Batch, and Single Barrel. I enjoyed learning about their ingredients and recipe process.

Value: Good value for a tasting and a glass.         

Ambiance: Relaxed, smaller than some of the others.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: Pretty standard. There were a few limited bottlings that were only available there.

Freebies: Four Roses glass.

Definitely Go If: If you like Four Roses and/or just want a quick, affordable tasting.

Definitely Avoid If: You want an in-depth tour.

George Dickel 
1950 Cascade Hollow Rd, Tullahoma, TN 37388

Highlight: Scenery and seeing their version of the Lincoln County process

Lowlight: None

Tour: Basic tour seeing the inner workings of their fairly small distillery. Decent amount of walking and stairs.

Tasting: Pretty good for $10. I got their White, 8, 12, and Barrel Select. The set-up was great too. I wished I didn‚Äôt have to leave.

Value: Above average. Good tour and tasting for $10      
Ambiance: I felt like I was visiting my family out in the country. The atmosphere was laid back and welcoming.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: The usual plus a 17 year bottle that‚Äôs apparently only available in some places.

Freebies: None

Definitely Go If: You want to see a full distillery tour with a tasting and don‚Äôt want the Jack Daniels crowds.

Definitely Avoid If: You would have to drive far out of your way and aren‚Äôt a big fan of George Dickel.

Jack Daniels 
133 Lynchburg Hwy, Lynchburg, TN 37352

Highlight: Tasting and a thorough tour

Lowlight: None

Tour (Angel‚Äôs Share Distillery Tour): Thorough and interactive. We learned about the Lincoln County Process, saw some Jack Daniels history, and saw the ins and outs of the distilling process. Walking and stairs included.

Tasting: I did one of the more expensive tours/tastings offered and it was worth it. We tried ‚Äú27 Gold‚Äù, ‚ÄúSinatra‚Äù, Single Barrel Select, Single Barrel Rye, and Single Barrel: Barrel Proof.

Value: Pricey ($22) but worth it. If you‚Äôre going to splurge, this is one place to do it.

Ambiance: I‚Äôve seen it described as Disney World for whiskey fans. I‚Äôd agree and disagree. It wasn‚Äôt in that it actually didn‚Äôt feel too overdone to me. I was expecting over-the-top when I hear that description. It was in the sense that it was clearly a tourist hot spot and everything seemed very professional and well-done.

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: The visitor center has a walk-through of whiskey and Jack Daniels history. The gift center is somewhat odd. You can buy a variety of whiskeys on site but any other trinket-type items are in various stores a short walk away in Lynchburg.

Freebies: None

Definitely Go If: You love Jack Daniels or you‚Äôre in the area and want to see what the big deal is.

Definitely Avoid If: You don‚Äôt like crowds.

Prichard‚Äôs
11 Kelso-Smithland Rd, Kelso, TN 37348

Highlight: None

Lowlight: None

Tour: Short walk through the garage where Prichard‚Äôs equipment is located.

Tasting: Free, and there are a lot of options (most of which are rum) that you get to pick four of.

Value: You can‚Äôt beat free but there isn‚Äôt too much to see.

Ambiance: Start-up

Visitor Center/Gift Shop: It‚Äôs all in one at the Kelso location. The facility is an old school house. The tasting and some items for sale are located inside the main room when you walk in.

Freebies: None

Definitely Go If: You‚Äôre interested in seeing a distillery that‚Äôs in the process of being created from the ground up.

Definitely Avoid If: You‚Äôre short on time and want to see a well-known spot.

The smoothness of this Irish whiskey astounded me, it goes down like water and the taste to me was great.  

I don't drink often but I think I now found my new drink of choice if I'm just gonna come home after a long day and have a small glass.

keegsb1,6xyi1n,25,whiskey,From party drinking to Sipping Whiskey,"Just joined this Sub after a surprisingly life changing experience.

When  I was in college I drank liquor for the same reason I drank anything else, to get drunk. With that reasoning in mind I never bothered to buy any worthwhile liquor.  I drank until I couldn't taste the terrible things I was consuming and years later I still have a bad taste in my mouth. 
Because of negative experiences I became a beer drinker (almost exclusively) and vowed that hard liquor was just not a taste I could acquire again.

Until Today.
A friend of mine recently accepted a job offer that effectively moves her and her husband across the country and moves them very quickly. (She has a week before she starts the job, she accepted Friday) As such we decided we needed to have at least one good dinner together and spend some time helping them prepare for the move. While we sat in their living room this afternoon they asked if, as a favor, we would take their stock of liquor as they didn't want to risk any bottles breaking during the drive.  I accepted a box of twelve bottles ranging from Grand Marnier (eh) to 2 bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon.  Mixed in this case of alcohol was a bottle of Buffalo Trace.  

After saying goodbye for the evening I came home and decided it was time to try sipping Whiskey again.  I poured 3 fingers with one ice cube and slurped my first taste straight to the back of my mouth and shivered with the familiar burn.  After I sat at my PC to partake in my nightly routine of reading the daily news I stopped to ponder how I was going to consume this drink without wasting it. 
In the middle of reading an article about a local tragedy I reached over to my glass and sipped a bit of Buffalo Trace onto the middle of my tongue.  I began to panic as my memory of whiskey on my tongue was filled with the likes of Lord Calvert and Jim Beam.  But before I could correct my mistake the damage was done.
I swallowed the bit of whiskey but the burn was overpowered by the phenomenal flavor that was left behind.  I closed my browser and turned to stare at my glass, hoping that the results of my last taste weren't a freak accident. I proceeded to take small taste after small taste.  Sometimes letting the amber liquid slide from the front to the back of my mouth and then down, and sometimes keeping the whiskey on my tongue and breathing 2-3 times just to find the different subtleties in each mouthful. 
My glass now sits empty and my heart is breaking because I know that the road that my friend has started me down is one that is filled with fickle taste-buds and an empty wallet. But really my heart is breaking because I want another glass and I know this bottle won't last forever.

lovetowel,6yf8zf,14,whiskey,"Is this ""rare"" whistlepig worth buying?","This week here at The Argonaut we are bringing you another exciting private barrel offering:  WhistlePig 12 Year Rye.  Back in June our General Manager, Mark Fetter, made the trip up to the WhistlePig farm in Vermont to personally blend a barrel of this awesome whiskey.  Mark ended up going with a 50/50 blend of 12 year old ryes finished in Madeira and French Sauternes casks.  Mark really knocked this one out of the park; this whiskey is flavorful, complex and endlessly drinkable.  The nose is rich with ripe fruit aromas, caramel, and oak.  On the palate you get an excellent mix of the rye spiciness and the sweeter notes of raisins, plums, honey and vanilla.  The finish is long and warm with hints of chocolate and cinnamon, a truly enjoyable experience. Our WhistlePig 12 year will be on sale this week here at The Argonaut so come on by and pick up a bottle of Mark's whiskey, you won't regret it.

So I have found that the only alcohol I enjoy since college is Whiskey, besides craft beer. I have been drinking different types on the rocks and not really taking time to experience and appreciate the flavors and aromas. I just got myself a couple Glencairn glasses and want to start tasting it neat.

My current collection:

Crown Royal

Glenlivet 12

Glenlivet Founder's Reserve 50ml

Glenlivet 15 Year 50ml


I just finished a bottle of bourbon that I enjoyed. I am looking to buy a couple new bottles to round out my collection and set me on the path of finding out my interests. So what bottles would you suggest I get next?

Also I watch a video and this guy pours some in his glass swirls it and throws it out so its ""clean"". I have a feeling that many do not do this. Can i just start with a dry glass or is there another method?

I also found it odd that Canadian whisky isnt a category in the intro post. How does this fall into the types? What makes it different?

Any other general tips for a noob would be appreciated. Specifically simplifying the types of whisky and what to look for in each.

Thanks for your advice.",24,2017-07-25 02:11:01

My friend and I went to a restaurant, quiet place so we could drink and chat in peace. I ordered a glass of Macallan 12 straight. The glass and the drink looks nice in the sun as well. Even before I tasted it, both me and my friend got a whiff of the strong and rich aroma. I personally really liked it from first taste onwards. It's smooth, nicely sweet and woody and the taste stayed with me for a good time afterwards, including the burn which is great. I normally don't drink whiskey straight but decided to go for what I did this time and didn't regret it. Took my time drinking it for the duration of my stay at the restaurant, had a nice buzz that lasted a while as well as the taste and burn.

I'm a pretty big Woodford Reserve fan. It's not a super-expensive bottle, but it's a great bourbon and I always try to have a bottle around the house for a glass or two after the workday.

Recently, I was out at a local bar--a drinker's drinking place, definitely--and they had a bottle of the Double Oaked the ready to see how patrons liked it. I was sold after the sip of the first pour.

But I was walking through a big liquor store the other day and noticed, to my surprise, that Woodford also makes a rye. Now, I'm usually more a bourbon than a rye guy, but I also like Bulleit Bourbon and Rye both. But I also know I like Woodford more than I like Bulleit Bourbon, so, shifting my expectations over, I assume I'll also like Woodford Rye a hell of a lot.

Can anyone give me a brief on it? Worth the few bucks, or did Woodford pull an unexpected swing-and-a-miss on this?",3,2017-06-22 23:16:36

Anyways, my newly found love of whiskey is based off of mostly Wisers, but some Canadian club. I've also tried some others, like Crown Royal.

Not that I have a particular tongue for whiskey yet, but I was thinking of treating myself to a nice bottle (in Canada). Anywhere between $50-$100. I don't want to waste my money if its shit liquor, so that's why I am turning to you.

I have only had jack daniels, or other affordable whiskeys in mix drinks with coke or something, but I am not really interested in those. I want to get something that will be a treat. A gift for myself for getting a new job. Something I can have a glass and enjoy when I get some alone time at home.

When I graduated college I bought myself an 8 year Isle of Skye. It had a bit too much ""nail polish remover"" to it and was hoping for something milder. My local grocery store had a tasting of some Mitcher's small batch bourbon. Which was pretty tasty, but I can't find any info regarding age or cask. Maybe I will come back to this one.

I don't really have a price range I am worried about, as long as I'm not spending hundreds of dollars.

iOwnYourFace,6jps1d,6,whiskey,How does one develop the ability to taste notes?,"I'm a big fan of whiskey. I enjoy drinking a small glass about 4 times a week, mainly for the taste and the feeling, never to get drunk. I was interested in a particular whiskey that I like, and I read the following review on it :

**Stewed apple and a slightly tart, acrid scent overwhelm at the beginning of nosing. Very dark caramelized wood and a lovely perfumed quality follow. As the whisky opens up, chewy toffee becomes apparent, transforming into the smell of overnight French toast‚Äîdense pumpernickel bread soaked in brown sugar and butter caramelizing together in perfect harmony. The butter note sticks in the nose throughout the tasting experience.**

My question is, HOW does one develop the ability to taste all of these things? I taste whiskey. I know I enjoy it, a lot, but are the things that this author references particular to him, or is this more likely what the distiller was actually going for? ",3,2017-06-27 10:22:41

I live in an area (New Brunswick, Canada) where liquor is very controlled.

I enjoy Fireball, I am getting used to Crown Royal, I was not a huge fan of Royal Reserve, and I liked Appleton Estate Rum. I am looking to pick up a true whiskey that would be considered drinkable to any of the members here. These are what I have come up with


Buffalo Trace 41.80


Bulleit Rye 37.79


Bulleit Bourbon Frontier Whiskey 38.99


Wild Turkey 81 Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon 32.79


Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 33.49


Maker's Mark 47.99


Jameson's Irish Whisky 19.49


Bushmills Original 31.28


Bushmills Black Bush 37.99


Bushmills 10 41.99


The price listed is what they cost in Canadian dollars. I was strongly considering Buffalo Trace as it is highly recommended to beginners here. But if someone knew of another that would be more appropriate for introducing a novice to Whiskey I would appreciate the input. Or if there are any others that I should try that are available at NB Liquor stores.


Thanks

Edit: Ended up picking up a bottle of Buffalo Trace. Had looked at Woodford Reserve as well, but figured I could try it next time. Found it to have a stronger burn than anything else I've tried. Looking forward to trying more types in the future.

Of course this is a question of personal taste and preference, but I read that one should aim for about 40-42 % ABV. Assuming one drop of water measures about 0.05 mL, this would mean one has to add 50 droplets (2.5 mL) to water down a 90 proof whiskey to 40 % ABV (double that for the 100 proof Rittenhouse Rye).

This seems extreme! People usually say they add just a few drops of water to the whiskey. This would practically make no difference in the ABV.

Not sure if I don't like it, or it's a bad Scotch...it was like $17. After having good experiences with Bourbons only a few dollars more I was expecting better.

Nose: Sharp Alcohol, not harsh or long lasting, just very biting. Hard for me to get past.
But also getting some fruit and nuts. Having a hard time pinning down specifics.
Maybe some brown sugar...? 
Adding some water makes the Alcohol retreat a bit, but it gets a bit thin with what notes I could get.

Taste: Fruity, maybe some kind of Vanilla as well, but I can't tell for sure. Not sure if this type of flavor is typical with Scotch, but I may wait a while to go back. Not a fan of the fruit tones.
But also it seems too thin, not much substance or complexity to it.
Also making me think of grass or something woody, not as a good thing though.


Finish: Short, too short for me. I'm quickly finding that I like long finishes. But on the finish it is still as fruity, maybe something flowery(floral?).


After a few pours over the weeks it hit me that this reminds me of a bad flavored Vodka, a watered down one at that.

Overall not a fan at all. 

I have no idea how to rate each thing. But I usually see ratings out of 100.

QuantizationRules,6dadd4,3,whiskey,Greenbar Distillery Six Woods Malt Whiskey - Compared to?,"Has anyone tried this in a large enough quantity to be able to help me out?  I searched and found a couple of older posts but nothing of note.  

I went to a cocktail class at this place (recommended, by the way...really cool people and fun little date).  They let us taste the Six Woods Malt, which was pretty tasty, as well as the Cask Strength expression.  I think it's in the 55% ABV range.  The Cask was excellent for my tastes, and I still love it.  It's pretty expensive though, at ~40 bucks for a 375ml.


Because it's expensive and sort of hard to get except for the distillery itself and a couple retailers, I've been searching for similar brands or taste profiles to supplement as a daily pour.  But I don't have anywhere near a refined enough palate to describe WHY I like it, or what I like about it.  I think I felt it was kind of sweet, so I went down the low-rye/wheated/high-barley bourbon path, but none of them seem to really fit the same profile.


Anyway, if anybody has tried this particular whiskey and would be able to recommend maybe a more readily available brand/expression, that would be great.  

tl;dr
Greenbar whiskey blows me away but is expensive and hard to get, I'd love to find something more readily available for normal occasions.  

EDIT:
The exercise I'm spending through is finding something that tastes like this particular whiskey.  I think I'd be happy if I could find something around $40ish / 750ml.  

EDIT2: Made it more clear that I'm looking for things that taste like this particular whiskey, not necessarily asking for recommendations of whiskeys I may enjoy (although that too would be welcome).",6,2017-05-25 23:35:38

Currently, he has the following: jonnie walker blue, glenmorangie signet, macallan whisky makers edition (has pictures of old cars on the box), macallan estate reserve, glenfiddich 21, dalmore 18, mortlach 18, john walker and sons xr 21, and camus xo. (I hope the names are right!) 

I know that he likes fruity and dislikes spicy. He recently tasted yamazaki 12 and did not like it at all. He was really excited to try it but was pretty disappointed. He said it was very watery (?). He also had a sample of jura 10 - he made an awful face and did not finish the sample. He is generally a big fan of macallan and jonnie walker blue. 

I looked through the recommendations posts and was thinking of glenfarclas 21. Would you say this will be a good choice? I am looking to spend max 300 dollars and we live in Virginia.

Tom_Bom,6dpa0g,11,whiskey,(Trailer Park boys) Liqourmens ol' Dirty Canadian Whiskey,"I figured I'd do a review of this, because it's only available in certain areas of Canada. This is a Whiskey endorsed by the trailer park boys, a famous comedic trio with a show that spans 12 seasons so far.

Purchasing this Whiskey, I didn't have high hopes because of the name. Luckily as I was soon found out, you never judge a bottle by its labeling. 

From the first sip, I was head over heels in LOVE with this Whiskey. Much better than Canadian Club, yet in the same price range. The flavor profile and nose is almost identical to Crown Royal. For me, I cannot tell much difference, except that it's a bit of a sassy liquor.

It is not a bottom shelf whiskey, certainly not a top shelf, so to me it sits somewhere comforatably in the middle. For the price it comes with (essentially the same as Canadian Club in price range), if you're buying in that price range, this Whiskey is the way to go if you really want to treat yourself.

Goes great with an episode of Trailer Park Boys as well. ;)

Let me know if you have any questions about it, i really enjoyed it.

Hamzok,6e14zv,0,whiskey,I need an advice,"Good day everyone.
I'm an 18 year old guy, whiskey is the only spirit I enjoy, that said, I live in a muslim country and well, alcohol is forbidden in Islam, I myself am not religious, neither is my Arabic dad and my Russian mum.
It is Ramadan now, an Islamic tradition that lasts for one month and during this month all liquor stores are forcibly closed until it's over, alcohol is legally sold here during all the year except for Ramadan, and can be legally consumed by 18+ year old individuals.
My parents were quite disappointed of the fact that I drink. I would say I'm a responsible person, and I know my limits, i have never drank more than 200ml a day which after research turned out to be quite a low amount considering how other people may drink.
Now my exams are coming in 1 month and whiskey used to help me A LOT in focusing and staying alert, i used to pour half a glass and study for about 5 hours with that same glass sitting infront of me, my parents have ordered me to stop until I finish my exams.. Because they believe alcohol will ruin me and lead me to the path of drug usage.
Ever since I started drinking it actually did some good for me, I quit smoking, started socialising more, sleeping well and generally felt better, it also pushed back my depression massively.
Now my 50 year old parents obviously know about everything more than I do.. So following their advices should never hurt me, but in this particular case, I feel like drinking could strongly benefit me until exams, and they are some very important exams!
Now my friend offered me a free 1000ml of a Jack Daniel's bottle that is most likely going to last for the whole Ramadan month for me.. Should I take it and relive the time I felt happier, more productive and creative in, or should I forget about it?
Keep in mind I haven't been able to study for the past week(ever since I had to pause drinking).

Code-E45,6eciu8,12,whiskey,"I'm new to whiskey, wild turkey 101 saved my foray into the world of bourbon","So I've only been giving Whiskey a shot for a few weeks now. Really didn't like it before (possibly because my first experience was Jack Daniels in a plastic bottle...).

I first went for Evan Williams Black Label because of the price/reviews. It was...rough to say the least. I was about to tap out when I noticed that Wild Turkey 101 was like $10 more (closer to $15 with taxes). I'm now on my second glass and actually loving it. Of course as a newbie I take it on the rocks so I'm not quite enjoying everything it has to offer.

If anyone new to Whiskey sees this, and has the similar access to the brands, I would say skip the super budget stuff, even if it's reviewed well. Go $10 or so above, you probably won't regret it.

But I have a question for the more experienced people out there, is there THAT big of a difference between the Evan Williams Black Label and Wild Turkey 101? Or is this just a preference I can't quantify yet, because it's night and day.",31,2017-05-31 11:58:57

j_on,6elrq9,14,whiskey,Current Collection. Please recommend some fancy double matured stuff!,"OK, not sure if you guys count it as a collection if I actually drink the bottles instead of just putting them on a shelf, but here you go: [Current collection](http://imgur.com/a/zWXCP)

I pretty much love every single bottle here. Two of my favorites are the Ardmore Port Wood Finish and the Glendronach 15 Tawny Port. The first bottle of Glendronach 15 Tawny Port was amazing, the current one not so much. It's been suggested that it might be batchy or I just got a bottle that wasn't stored right. Or maybe it's me, not sure.

Anyway, I'd really like to try other whisky's with a ""fancy"" finish instead of just bourbon/sherry. Or maybe there's even whisky that matured in some unusual cask all the way? One that I tried and didn't like was the Balvenie 14 Carribean Cask... guess rum is just not my thing.

Please recommend Scotch and Japanese whisky if possible. I'm in Taiwan and those two are much easier to find than Irish or American whiskey.

I prefer 43-46%, peated or unpeated are both fine. Price range ideally up to 70‚Ç¨. Or up to 100‚Ç¨ if you think it's really worth it.

/edit: Thanks!! :)

/edit2: This is the website of the closest shop around my house, in case you want to take a look at prices and whisky selection in Taiwan: I removed the link, PM me if you really want to know!

/edit3: **Recommendations**

* Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban (Port finish)
* Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or (Sauternes finish)
* Benriach 17 Solstice (Port finish)
* Angels Envy Rye (Rum finish)
* Laphroaig Cairdeas (different finish every year)
* Longrow Red (different wine finish every year)
* Springbank 10 (""no weird finishes but a very distinctive, unique and tasty bottle"")
* WhistlePig (?)

I went to the store and came home with a Madeira finished Glenmorangie Bacalta. Something like a compromise between the recommended Laphroaig Cairdeas (the 2016 one is Madeira finished) and the Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban. Will try it tonight. :) Thanks everyone!",14,2017-06-01 18:04:35

TheWhiskeyDic,6epd7t,28,whiskey,Maker's Mark - Review #8,"**Fun Facts**

1. They spell their product as ""Whisky"" instead of ""Whiskey"" like most bourbons.  This is to pay homage to their Irish-Scottish Heritage.
2. The red wax, the mark (S IV), and the label were all designed by William Samuel's Wife Margie.
3. If you get a bottle of Maker's Mark that's been dunked all the way down to the label, it's referred to as a [""Slam Dunk""](http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/makers-mark.jpg).

**Stats**
**Image:**
[Bottle](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yf8PeyTOPsE/maxresdefault.jpg)

**Proof**
86.8

**Distillery:**  [Maker's Mark](https://www.makersmark.com)

**Style:** Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey

**Aged:** Between 6-7 years for the bourbon

**Nose:** 
Light and Crisp, Sweet Corn, Honey, Cinnamon

**Taste:** 
Truly nothing out of the ordinary here for a bourbon, but where this bourbon shines is in it's proportions.  The taste hits you like any other, cinnamon, honey, vanilla, oak... but it's the proportions that really make this whiskey shine.

**Opinion:**
I would absolutely recommend keeping a bottle of this whiskey on hand.  It's great for cocktails like Manhattans, Old Fashioned, or anything else that requires bourbon.

Thanks for reading!

We bought said bottle. I just googled the EH Taylor Single Barrel and it seems to be getting mixed reviews.

He typically drinks Knob Creek or Makers.

This coworker has made quite a few recommendations to me for things to try. He has also been an awesome person for my wife to work with. Our goal isn't to impress him just to get him something he'll enjoy that he may not always buy otherwise.

phasestep,67rher,5,whiskey,The art of american whiskey - a book review,"I had not intended for The Art of American Whiskey to be my first foray into the whiskey world, but I had it in my wish list and Amazon kindly informed me that it was on sale for $9, as opposed to the list price of $20.  Ostentatiously, this book is the history of American Whiskey as told through classic and modern Whiskey labels.  I‚Äôm no art historian by any means so I mostly had this book on list out of curiosity.  What I got instead was a book on American Whiskey history that periodically showed me pictures of labels.

Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.  It was easy reading, keeping you entertained and informed in equal measure.  It was certainly more informative than I had hoped to get, at least as far as history knowledge.  It was well focused enough that once done, I felt like I had a solid handle on whiskey culture in America, but it left the reader with plenty of other questions and the desire to find answers.  I was less pleased because, while the history was more directly useful to me, I was hoping for a greater emphasis on explaining the art behind the labels.  Like I said before, I am no art historian.  I don‚Äôt even qualify as an art enthusiast.  To tell me that this label is exemplary of art styles of the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs is‚Ä¶ unhelpful.  The book didn‚Äôt even really go into what made a label successful or otherwise, or even which labels *were* successful.  While I‚Äôm sure that is more of a marketing standpoint, I doubt the world is ripe for a marketing book that directly addresses American Whiskey labels and their history‚Ä¶ and if it is, please, please somebody write that and let me buy it.

The book was delightfully liberal with fun facts and brand history (though I am very curious as to whether or not certain brands were represented more through some sort of agreement) such as the in depth telling of how Makers Mark came to be or the fact that Heavens Hill is the largest family owned and operated distillery in the States (as of the time of writing).  I would most certainly recommend this book to the casual enthusiast and probably to the more dedicated enthusiasts too, though with a grain of salt.  It would make an excellent coffee-table or cocktail-table book and it certainly looks nice behind the bar.

I figured that Ardbeg would overpower Dalwhinnie's soft character, but they complement each other perfectly.

TheWhiskeyDic,68ogoy,8,whiskey,Amador Double Barrel - Review #7,"**Fun Facts**

*(Admittedly, not so ""fun"" this time)*

1. Sourced from multiple distilleries and then finished in a wine cask (I suspect cabernet based off the company's other products and the nose).
2. The second attempt at a whiskey by the Trinchero family after their [10 Barrel](http://www.amadorwhiskeycompany.com/bourbons.html#ten-barrel) which was 96 proof.

**Stats**

**Image:**
[Bottle](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kRYzAFwyuWk/maxresdefault.jpg)

**Proof**
86.8

**Company:**  [Amador](http://www.amadorwhiskeycompany.com) (or the Trinchero family estate)

**Type:** Kentucky Bourbon aged in Napa valley wine barrels

**Aged:** Between 3 - 10 years for the bourbon, finished for 6 months in a wine cask.

**Nose:** 
It smells like when you're making a Manhattan and you decide to put a splash of cherry juice in the drink rather than just the cherry.

**Taste:** 
Vanilla, oak, brown sugar and spice

**Opinion:**
After the enjoyable nose, the taste is disappointing.  It tastes like a run of the mill bourbon.  This was given to me as a gift, and that person bought it for $25... for $25, it's worth a purchase for the nose alone, but at it's normal value of $40, I'd suggest skipping this one.

Thanks for reading!

[deleted],69bsa3,14,whiskey,Going from tumbler to nosing glass,"After using tumblers for years I've finally decided to pick up some proper nosing glasses for whiskey. I was looking at the Glencairn glass but I decided to pick up the Libbey Perfect Whiskey glasses because it was a lot cheaper and had positive reviews.

My first impression, using some bourbon, is a bit of a disappointment. It does give you a stronger smell, but it's also different. With a nosing glass I get a lot more alcohol and acetone smell from the whiskey and less of the vanilla and honey aroma. I feel like with a tumbler the alcohol is less concentrated in the glass and you can get different smells from it. I will have to do more testing, maybe it will be better with peated scotch, but so far it's a bit disappointing.

TheVojo,61cfp0,17,whiskey,Help me identify this Unpleasant flavor in JW &amp; Ballantines,"I've been trying different whiskeys, and there has been one specific flavor in certain whiskeys that is extremely unpleasant to me.

Could you help me identify this flavor is so that I know how to avoid it. 
I've experienced this flavor in the following Whiskys: JW Black &amp; Ballantines.

From what I've read so far on here, I think it's smoke or maybe peat, it is pretty powerful and it lingers. It reminded me of the nasty taste I thought Whiskey had way back when I'd go through my father's whisky stash as a teenager (he usually had the cheaper stuff). Cannot narrow it down any further than that. 

On the other hand, this flavor is not present at all in other whiskys I've drank, a few examples of the one that I've tried recently and have none of it:
Wild Turkey 81, Woodford Reserve, Jameson, Bushmills, Macallan 18, Cutty Sark

So it seems like JW Black &amp; Ballantines have a certain component that is different in them that adds this unpleasant (to me) flavor.

DramlerApp,625ejc,50,whiskey,I'm Building A Social Platform for Whiskey Enthusiasts,"Hello to all of you whiskey Redditors! I'm the co-founder of a startup called Dramler (https://dramler.com) and we're building a social platform for whiskey enthusiasts. Dramler is a social platform which allows you to discover, define and share your whiskey experience!

I, like many of my peers, have recently started to delve more and more into the World of Whiskey (not to be confused with the World of Warcraft). What really ticked me off is that the existing social platforms are pretty terrible at providing a tailored experience which can fully accommodate the interest of whiskey enthusiasts. 

**From Burbn to Instagram**  
Interestingly, [Instagram started out as Burbn](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-genesis-of-Instagram), which was an app based on Kevin Systrom's interest in bourbon and fine whiskeys. I would definitely recommend that everybody reads up on that story, but it's certainly evident that people have been thinking about a similar idea long before we have. 

**Vanilla Social**  
Existing social sites/apps (like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) are too noisy and don't provide a tailored social experience, which is needed in a vertical like whiskey. They don't understand that people want to describe their interests and experiences with more than just a picture and a text box.  

**The Current Apps**  
None of the current apps have captured any significant mindshare nor have they been particularly successful. And it's certainly not because such an app isn't needed, Vivino, from the World of Wine (not to be confused with the World of Whiskey or the World of Warcraft) demonstrated that such a platform can connect upwards of 25 million people based solely around their wine interest. We suspect they're going to grow quite a bit beyond 25 million, but we think that the whiskey world deserves its own special app too. 

**Dramler**  
Given all the issues above, we decided to build a social platform which allows you to discover, define and share your whiskey experience! 

Anyway, I'm here because I think that you guys deserve an awesome social platform and I'd love to get your feedback. Also happy to answer any questions!

Just wondering if I keep drinking whiskey, will the burn start to seem less and less over weeks/months?

What is your own experience with this? How long did it take you?

Sadly, a few bottles are beginning to run low in my collection (Baby Saz, HP12, Hakushu 12, EHTSmB, Cairdeas 2016, Balvenie Doublewood, RB12 CS, etc) and so the time to replenish my stock is drawing nigh.

FreakyCheeseMan,633ped,9,whiskey,Pricey whiskey to save for special occasion?,"First off, to be clear: I know that I'm being silly by specifically looking for an expensive whiskey. But I have some money to burn and this sounds like a fun way to do it.

I'm about to start grad school, and I've been getting more interested in whiskey lately. I've been considering spending some semi-serious money (a few hundred) on a bottle of something very nice, to be kept as celebration for when I get my Master's Degree.

I like a few scotches (Oban and Laphroaig), but I'm really more of a bourbon fan (Woodford Double Oaked probably being my go to, though I also like Eagle Rare... not so much a fan of Angel's Envy) Lately I've been getting into Japanese whiskey, though... I had a bottle of the Yamazaki 12 a few months ago, and while I was kind of dumb and drank it too fast (didn't realize it's actually hard to get), I remember quite enjoying it.

So, right now I'm considering hunting down a bottle of the Yamazaki 18, but I have no idea if I'll be able to find one, if I'd have to grossly over-pay if I did, or if I could get something better for the same price... so, I'm looking for other high-end treats to consider? (Not JWB, btw. Had it once, and while it was certainly not bad, it didn't fascinate me.)

EDIT: To be clear, I'm looking at spending probably $400+, and I know that at that point, whatever it is, I'll probably be over-paying for it... I just want to get the best and most interesting thing I can in that range, even if most of what I'm paying for is more rarity than quality. (This is a treat I plan to spend a couple years looking forward to... I want it to be genuinely outside of what I can do under remotely normal circulsances.)",29,2017-04-03 09:28:32

1. Tommy's Batch is named after Tommy Crume who worked alongside Booker Noe for many years.
2. Tommy retired at the end of 2016 after 30 years with the company, and that's why he gets the honor of the first batch of 2017 named after him.

**Stats**

**Company:**  Jim Beam

**Type:** Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon (64.25% ABV)

**Aged:** 6 years 6 months 4 days

**Nose:** 
Vanilla, Oats (like a newly opened package of oatmeal), Nuts

**Taste:** 
Vanilla, Caramel, Smokey corn (like grilled corn!)

**Mouth Feel:**
The burn is mighty, so this is a small sipper.  Thick and pleasing.

**Opinion:** Buy it if you're a Booker's fan, skip it if you've never tried Booker's and wait for the next batch.

NoodledLily,5voiue,5,whiskey,"Insurance Recommendations - Storage at home larger collections, small space experience?","**TLDR two questions:**

* Recommended insurance companies or salespeople to reach out to for whisky/collectables
* Advice on storage from large collectors with limited space.

Our whisky collection has grown and we are running out of space. Right now we have bottles stored in multiple locations... [Some shots of current setups.](http://imgur.com/a/8kP8v)

Have you solved this problem? Sorry this might come off as a humblebrag.

Any advice from other larger volume collectors, especially those with limited space? Do you organize if you stack bottles deep and how deep? Labels/apps? Shelf suggestions?

PS we have the same problem with wine, but we're getting a wine fridge soon.

Also want to get insurance after walking away clean from a very costly disaster while moving bottles..

Does anyone have company or contact that specializes in whisky and pr other collectables? Have home owners insurance, afraid it's not enough...",15,2017-02-23 13:24:11

They generally don't add much value and often come across as fishing expeditions to find buyers.

We're not your bottle blue book. 

**Dusty Bottles: General Guidelines**

- If it's a common bottom-shelf bottle like Canadian Club, Chivas Regal or other common Blended Scotch, it's almost never worth enough to sell so drink it. If it's still around today, buy a current bottling and tell us how they compare!
- Selling alcohol without a license in the US is illegal. The only legal way to sell old or rare bottles is to auction them off. Hammer and shipping fees can add up so bottles with even a modest appreciation aren't worth selling.
- Generally speaking whiskey does not ""go bad."" The largest risk with old whiskey is oxidation. Contact with air will cause the spirit to get a bit cloudy and oxidized. It's still safe to drink but it might taste flat and weak.
- Be mindful of the cork when you open an older bottle. It might crumble so have a spare cork ready just in case.
- Opened bottles have little or no value.
- Novelty ceramic containers sometimes contain lead which can leech into the spirit so drink from them sparingly.

Personally I'm a fan of more peaty stuff (I had a bottle of Old Putney that I finished a few months ago that was fantastic) and I don't think she has much of a preference. 

As far as I can tell the issue with gluten is that there's something wheat-based used to coat barrels sometimes?

1. Glen Moray used to be a brewery called Western Brewery.
2. The distillery was closed down for about a decade in the early 1900s until it was resurrected by Glenmorangie.

**Stats**

**Company:**  Glen Moray

**Type:** Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky (40% ABV)

**Aged:** 12 Years

**Nose:** 
Apple, Pear, Apricot, Peach, generally fruity

**Taste:** 
Similar to the nose, you'll get apple, pear, light fruit, crystallized Sugar

**Mouth Feel:**
Extremely smooth finish.  Zero burn and tasty

**Rating:** - **Buy It**

**Opinion:** I would suggest buying a bottle of this whisky.  I'd suggest it equally because of it's low price and the taste.  This whisky won't blow you away with flavor, but it's a good example of a Speyside whisky for beginners.

Thanks for reading!

superboots,5xru1r,9,whiskey,"I went to Whiskey Rocks NW last night, it kinda sucked","The main reason why it sucked was that they were using plastic tasting cups and they stank, really bad like plastic chemical type smell. I went into the bathroom and washed mine three times to try to get rid of the smell, it helped but it was still bad.

A contributing factor to the suckage was how crowded it was, but that's a minor detail next to the stinky cup fiasco.

Other than those two details it was an awesome event, I wish they hadn't dropped the ball on such an important detail.

Standard tickets were $55, included 10 tastings (and they said it included a tasting glass but all I got was a stinky plastic cup). The pours were maybe 1/4 oz? very small but it was actually kinda nice, I got to try about 14 different whiskeys and my sense of taste and smell held up pretty well because of the low consumption. What was really cool about the tasting system was that everything cost one tasting, Macallan Rare Cask and Pappy Van Winkle 15 yr cost the same as Jack Daniels Honey and Evan Williams.

If I were to do it all over again, (which I would only do if they solve the stinky tasting cup issue) I would spend $90 on the VIP tickets which get you in an hour early and get you I think a total of 14 tastings. They had a surprising amount of high end (&gt;$200) bottles but pretty much only had one of each so once they ran out they were gone. I was still surprised how long most of them lasted though.

The event was in Seattle, WA and they were also selling some bottles for significantly lower prices than we usually get here which was cool. I got bottles of Balvenie 12 yr, Buffalo Trace, and Templeton Rye 6 yr for a total of $101, would have been $155 after tax at my local Total Wine.

Here's the list of bottles that were available to taste http://i.imgur.com/7jUIcmA.jpg good luck reading that.

And here's my very poorly done notes on what I tried:

The plastic tasting glasses stunk so I didn‚Äôt feel very confident in my observations

* Macallan Fine Oak 15 yr - I could barely taste this, all I could smell was the plastic from my cup. The flavor was ok.

* Teeling Whiskey Irish Single Malt - Not a big fan, some off flavors in my opinion 

* Glen Moray Single Malt Port Cask - Not bad, wasn‚Äôt blown away though.

* Balvenie 12 yr Doublewood 43% - I liked the doublewood, very solid well rounded whiskey

* Balvenie 14 yr Caribbean Cask - I also liked the Caribbean Cask, it was more popular than the doublewood, it was a little sweeter and smoother. I could go either way depending on my mood.

* Highland Park 18 yr - The peat was very prominent, definitely not anything massively different from the 12, it was pretty good, I wish I had a little more time with this one, and a better glass.

* Macallan Rare Cask - Was very good and very Macallan, wish my tasting cup didn‚Äôt stink so I could have experienced more subtlety.

* Blanton's 46.5% - I really liked Blanton‚Äôs, I‚Äôd put it near the top of bourbons that I‚Äôve tried. Would buy a bottle for sure.

* Glenfarclas 17 yr - Wow this one hits you in the face with fruit. Also it‚Äôs good. Would buy.

* Pappy Van Winkle 15 yr - I didn‚Äôt strongly dislike it but I‚Äôd put it in the bottom half of the bottles that I tried that night. Not a big fan.

* Jack Daniels Single Barrel - Bleh, I wasn‚Äôt feeling this one. Tasted like Jack Daniels bottled at higher ABV, not Jack Daniels we picked the most special casks and then bottled them for you.

* Woodford Reserve Double Oaked - Haha, it tasted like oak, shocker. I remember thinking that it was a stronger flavor than I was expecting, I didn‚Äôt like it as much as I thought I would, but I didn‚Äôt dislike it. Would like to try again.

* Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Barley - Wow I really liked this one, peaty but in the best way. I don‚Äôt know what else to say, would definitely buy.

* Bruichladdich Octomore 07.3 - Also very good, I think I liked the Islay Barley a little better but not only is the peat very strong, it‚Äôs also incredibly good and interesting. Would buy if it wasn‚Äôt like $150 a bottle.

Edit: Changed Bruichladdich Islay Barley to Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Barley after realizing I had written down the wrong bottle.",12,2017-03-06 14:43:12

I'm mostly a bourbon and rye drinker, but I've had a few bottles of Monkey Shoulder come through my collection.

I happened to make it with loose leaf oolong, around 6 ounces, Glenn Moray Elgin Classic, around 1.5 ounces, and a half a tablespoon of honey.

I am trying weird stuff with the Moray, because I don't care for it so much on its own. It did work well here, and is putting me right to bed frankly.

Give it a try, especially if you can spare a dram of something you don't particularly care for. Pairing the flavors can be interesting.

bholt22,5q7jdi,1,whiskey,Bracket for Scotch Help,"Hey Folks, i'm putting together a blind scotch tasting bracket to determine which is the best (according to our 4 judges). In total there are 3 ""regions"" with 6 scotches in each region. The two best in each region go on to the finals, while the 3rd &amp; 4th place in each region go into a second chance region. So at the end there will be 8 scotches in the finals to square off.

I'm looking for suggestions on which 18 scotches I should put in the bracket. I'm avoiding heavily peated scotches (as those are so distinct that I'll do a second bracket for them...(Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Lagavulin, etc..). Other than that just looking for a nice cross section of scotches from different price ranges, locations, distilleries, blend/single, etc. So far I have acquired 14 of the 18 bottles, they are .... Johnnie Green, Johnnie Platinum, Johnnie Blue, Black Bull 21, Hedonism, Monkey Shoulder, Kirkland's 24 yr blend, Glendronach Allardice 18, Glenlivet 12, Talker 18, Signet, Ballantines 17, Old Pulteney 17, and Old Pulteney 21.

Here are others i'm considering for the final 4... Dalmore Alexander, Macallan 18, Macallan no.2, Balvenie 15, Balvenie Caribbean, Glenfiddich 15 Solera, Glenfiddich 18, Highland Park 18, Glen Grant 18, Glengoyne 21, and Springbank 12 cask strength. Also was considering Hibiki 17, but wasn't sure if the Japanese style would stand out differently than a traditional scotch.

Would love some opinions on which of those 4 to include...or some suggestions I haven't thought of. Thanks, Cheers",5,2017-01-26 09:53:49

rawr92,5r9qxb,11,whiskey,Best 10 year old whiskeys?,"I've read through some posts here, but I'm still a bit lost...hence my question!

My boyfriend is turning 30 and has recently gotten into whiskey. I originally wanted to buy him a nice 30 year old bottle, but I'm unable to order any online (not allowed to ship liquor direct to the consumer in the county I live in) and the options for 30 year old at the local liquor stores are way out of my price range at $800+ for a bottle. 

I'm thinking I'd like to get him 3 different 10 year old whiskey bottles. He likes Johnnie Walker and Knob Creek, but I'm afraid that's all I really have to go off of as far as his whiskey preferences. He's never really had the ""fancier"" brands. He'd probably prefer it to be on the higher proof side, but I'm thinking all the whiskey's are going to be around the same proof? 

My budget is up to $100 per bottle (the $50-75 range would be nice, if possible, as I'd like to get him other gifts too). So I'm basically looking for suggestions for good 10 year old whiskeys that are under $100. I've tried googling around too, but that hasn't been too helpful.

 Anyway, in his booze cabinet I found a yellow box. It is ""White Horse Fine Old Scotch Whisky"". The thing is - they don't make this ""model"" anymore. He was in retirement for around 25 years, meaning he bought the bottle cca. 30 years ago. Therefore, I cannot for the life of me find the exact same bottle on the internet to learn something about it.

I was wondering if some of you kind gentlemen will help me understand this drink. I'm interested about the value of it, the quality and everything I can know about it.

ArekTheZombie,5k9uqy,8,whiskey,Question about tasting,"Hi Everyone,

I got into drinking whiskey without mixers and actually enjoying the taste pretty recently ( about 2-3 months) and didn't try too much of the good stuff (my best bottles are Glenfiddich 12 single malt and Jameson Select Reserve Black Barrel), but I couldn't taste or smell all the different things you can see in the tasting notes or reviews if my life dependent on it.

Usually I sip it neat without ice, but even when I add a bit water I still can only feel ""whiskey taste"". I try keeping it in my mouth for a little bit and slowly inhaling and the exhaling through nose. No butterscotch, no vanilla, no cream, just different whiskey taste with different bottles, which is fine but in the back of my head I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of enjoyment, and sometimes think that maybe those reviewers making all that stuff up, since I read that different people will tastes different things in the same bottle? Or am I just not experienced enough to taste those subtle things? Are there people that never get to taste all that stuff in whiskey?

So, toss me a few of your recommendations for a beginner whiskey drinker, and maybe I'll give them a try!

I'd say the only whiskey Im not a huge fan of is Scotch. if you could provide any help that would be wonderful

Don't know much about whiskey but want to find out if whiskey is right for you? Here's a comprehensive guide for you. This guide covers two main topics: **How should I enjoy my whiskey?** and **Which whiskey should I drink?**

***
***

####How should I enjoy my whiskey?

Many get confused about *how* to drink whiskey. What's the *optimal* way to enjoy a glass of whiskey? Is adding ice ok? What type of glassware should I use? and so on...

The good news is that there's no universal agreement on the best way to enjoy a glass. You've got lots of room to explore and find out what works best for you. As long as you're enjoying your whiskey, you're doing it right. Here are a few different popular approaches to drinking whiskey along with their upsides and downsides:

&amp;nbsp;

**Whiskey-Based Cocktails**

&gt; **Suggested Glassware:** A Cocktail Glass    
&gt; **Suggested Cocktails:** Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Mix with Ginger Ale

&gt; **Upsides:**

&gt; * Very approachable and easy to drink. Especially for those not accustomed to drinking full-proof spirits
&gt; * Mix and match. Experiment and see which spirits pair best with different mixers

&gt; **Downsides:**

&gt; * Masks the flavor of the whiskey so you can only appreciate a portion of what the spirit offers. Sort of defeats the purpose if you're interested in experiencing the full spectrum of what whiskey can offer.
&gt; * Some whiskies are made for mixing/shooting while others are made for drinking on their own. As a result, many whiskies don't hold up well in cocktails. You would experience fewer whiskies if you only stuck to cocktails.

&amp;nbsp;

**Adding Ice**

&gt; **Suggested Glassware:** A Rocks Glass with a heavy base

&gt; **Upsides:**

&gt; * Chilled whiskey has less burn
&gt; * More refreshing
&gt; * Some feel that introducing water can ""open up"" a glass and bring out hidden flavors.
&gt; * More casual. Rocks glasses feel good in your hand

&gt; **Downsides:**

&gt; * Chilling will dull some flavors and aromas (this may be a good thing with some cheap whiskies though)
&gt; * Fairly difficult to control how much water ends up in your glass so you sometimes end up with whiskey-flavored ice water towards the end of your glass
&gt; * Pressures you to drink more quickly so you don't end up with whiskey-flavored water 
&gt; * Limits your glassware. Ice does not work well in certain types of whiskey glasses (e.g. Glencairns)

&amp;nbsp;

**Adding a Splash of Water**

&gt; **Suggested Glassware:** A tulip-shaped glass like a Glencairn or Copita

&gt; **Upsides:**

&gt; * Reduces the burning sensation
&gt; * Some feel that introducing water can ""open up"" a glass and bring out hidden flavors. 
&gt; * Keeps the spirit at a more ideal temperature for nosing and tasting (room temperature)
&gt; * Allows you to control exactly how much water you add and get the profile you prefer

&gt; **Downsides:**

&gt; * Water could bring out less desirable flavors and aromas.
&gt; * Diluting whiskey sometimes just makes it taste duller and weaker. Water simply changes the flavor and doesn't always make it better.

&amp;nbsp;

**Neat (Undiluted)**

&gt; **Suggested Glassware:** A tulip-shaped glass like a Glencairn or Copita

&gt; **Upsides:**

&gt; * Highest concentration of flavor and aroma available which means fuller flavors and longer finishes
&gt; * Presumably, the distiller chose a specific proof because s/he feels that specific alcohol level brings out its best qualities. With undiluted whiskey, you're experiencing more of the distiller's craft, talent, and intent.

&gt; **Downsides:**

&gt; * The alcohol burn can overwhelm some drinkers and interfere with enjoyment

&amp;nbsp;

Personally, after a bunch of experimentation, I found I prefer my whiskey neat in a glencairn glass. I feel the glencairn glass enhances the nose quite a bit and is easy to handle. Over time, I've gotten used to the burn so I don't usually feel a need to add water or ice. Also, I have never felt that adding water changed the whiskey enough for me to care.

However, this is just one way to drink whiskey. Experiment and find what works best for you. Your preferences might change over time. For me, I got accustomed to the burning sensation so I gradually eased off the water. Eventually I found myself drinking nearly everything neat.

##Which whiskey should I drink?

There are a wide range of whiskies from all over the world which encompass a wide range of styles. It's up to you to determine which style works best for you. If you're just starting out, I'd recommend sticking with bottles in the 80-100 proof range.

There are two main categories of whiskies: Bourbon and Malt Whiskey. Here's how they break down:

&amp;nbsp;

####Bourbon

Bourbon is made in America in new oak barrels. It's primarily made from corn with some other flavoring grains like rye or wheat. Some common flavor and aroma descriptors are: vanilla, caramel, oak, cinnamon and brown sugar. As you may notice, they tend to taste sweeter and spicier.  Proof can make a big difference in this category which is why a few recommendations clock in at or near 100 proof.  

Bourbons also tend to offer a better value in the lower price ranges so if you're especially sensitive to price, I'd recommend that you focus on bourbon. Here's what's worth checking out:

Name         | Price range| Notes 
:-----------|:----------: |:-----------
Evan Williams Black Label |$13| Lots of brown sugar. Simple but pleasant.
Old Grandad Bottled in Bond |$20| A bit spicier with a full, sweet flavor
Rittenhouse Rye |$20-25 | Not technically a bourbon but related. Spicier and a touch less sweet.
Wild Turkey 101 |$20-25| Cherry and vanilla with a toasty oak backbone
Evan Williams Single Barrel |$23-26| A prototypical and well-rounded bourbon
Maker's Mark |$25| Wheat is used as a flavoring grain which gives it a softer and sweeter profile
Buffalo Trace |$20-25| Classic bourbon profile with big vanilla sweetness and oak
Elijah Craig Small Batch | $25 |
Four Roses Single Barrel |$40-50  | A spicier, more intense bourbon from a beloved distiller.
High West Rendezvous Rye | $45-55  | 
Blanton's Single Barrel |$50-60  | Smooth flavor with a long finish, prominent orange flavor and comes in a fancy bottle too!


&amp;nbsp;

####Malt Whiskey

Malt whiskey is a pretty broad category that encompasses some heavy hitters. Namely, Scotch, Irish and Japanese whiskies. They're all related because they use similar ingredients and production processes. 

Their distillation centers around malted barley. In nearly all cases, the spirit is aged in used casks. Malt whiskies tend to age longer than their Bourbon counterparts. Most are also imported which means they tend to cost a bit more in the US. Generally speaking, I have a tough time finding a malt whiskey that excites me for under $40 a bottle. 

Malt whiskies can exhibit a wide range of characteristics ranging from smokey and earthy to light and fruity. Sample as much as possible by buying minis, splitting bottles with friends, or going to a bar with a good selection to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Here are some to try:

***

**Light/Fruity**  

Name        | Price Range| Type
:-----------|:----------:|:----------
Speyburn 10 | $25 | Speyside Scotch
Teeling Small Batch | $25-30 | Irish
Monkey Shoulder | $30-35 | Vatted Scotch
Glenfiddich 12 | $35 | Speyside Scotch
Compass Box Great King Street  |$35-45 | Blended Scotch
Dalwhinnie 15    |$45-60 | Highland Scotch
Green Spot | $50 | Irish
Glenlivet 18 | $80-100 | Speyside Scotch

***

**Balanced**

Name     | Price Range| Type
:---------|:-----------:|:----------
Johnnie Walker Black | $35 | Blended Scotch
Balvenie 12 Doublewood |$40-60 | Speyside Scotch
Johnnie Walker Green | $45-60 | Vatted Scotch
Benromach 10 | $50-60 | Speyside Scotch
Highland Park 18  |$120-130 | Island Scotch
  
*****  
**Japanese**     
Japanese whiskey has become very trendy recently so it has been suffering from some supply issues. As a result, it can be tough to find a reasonably-priced and tasty bottle. Nearly all Japanese whiskey falls into the ‚ÄúLight/Fruity‚Äù and ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù categories so the whiskies listed in those categories are suitable substitutions. Personally, Japanese whiskey tends to taste like boring, overpriced Scotch to me so I tend to avoid it but lots of others love it so give it a shot!

Name         | Price Range
:---------|:-----------|
Nikka from the Barrel         |$30-50 (500ml) *Not sold in the U.S.*
Hibiki Harmony       |$60-75
Yamazaki 12      |$80-115
Kavalan Single Malt (Taiwanese) | $70-80

***

**Sherried/Sweet**

Type| Price Range        | Type
:---------|:-----------:|:----------
Glenmorangie La Santa | $45 | Highland Scotch
Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered        |$50-65 | Speyside Scotch
The Macallan 12 Sherry   |$50-60 | Speyside Scotch
GlenDronach 12   |$50-60 | Speyside Scotch
Glenfarclas 21 | $120 | Speyside Scotch

*****  

**Smoky/Peaty**    
*Read more about peated whiskey in the [Intro to Peated Whisk(e)y](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/5crusj/an_intro_to_peated_whiskey/)*

Name       | Price Range| Type
:-----------|:----------:|:----------
Laphroaig 10 | $40-55 | Islay Scotch
Ardbeg 10  |$45-55 | Islay Scotch
Talisker 10 | $50-65 | Island Scotch
Lagavulin 16  |$57-90 | Islay Scotch
  
*****  

**Something Different**

Name      | Price Range| Type
:---------|:-----------:|:----------
Old Pulteney 12 | $35-40 | Highland Scotch. Fruity and salty
Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban |$40-60 | Highland Scotch finished in barrels that once held port wine
Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask |$55-80 | Speyside Scotch finished in barrels that once held rum
Springbank 10 | $55-65 | Campeltown Scotch. Vanilla custard with a little peat

***

**Smoothness**    
Most newbies start out preferring lower-proof and mellow pours because they have trouble getting past the alcohol burn. However, there's usually a point where a whiskey enthusiast gets accustomed to the burn and starts valuing flavor over smoothness. At around that time, enthusiasts often find that whiskies they once thought tasted smooth start coming across as flat and weak. 

I've tried to limit my suggestions here to whiskies that bridge the gap between interesting flavor and drinkability. However, I can't predict your comfort level with spirits so I can't guarantee that you'll have an easy time drinking them all. If you have trouble tolerating the burn then feel free to add water or mixers to your glass or stick to easy-drinking, 80-proof pours like Evan Williams, Gentleman Jack, Johnnie Walker or Teeling Small Batch until you're more acclimated to drinking whiskey. 

***
***

I hope that was helpful. Just remember to enjoy yourself throughout this process. Many folks get all twisted around the various customs associated with drinking whiskey or feel insecure because they don't taste the same flavors as others. Don't worry too much about that stuff. Taste is personal and you'll figure out what works best for you. Treat it as an adventure and trust your gut as you taste a range of whiskies.

I'd also recommend sampling a broad range of pours by buying minis, splitting bottles with friends, or going to a bar with a good selection to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Feel free to post questions or corrections below. Cheers!",32,2016-12-28 08:22:06

Ghostwriter574,5kt8q5,13,whiskey,"Newish to whiskey, would love to find a ""go-to"" for myself. hoping for suggestions from more experienced drinkers than myself!!","I realize whiskey is something I need to try lots of and is very personal. I was just hoping those with lost of tasting experience can help guide where I begin.

First, I am not a fan of the ""burn"". A little is okay (and obviously unavoidable), but it makes me not want to enjoy whiskey if I have to wince and dread drinking stuff with powerful alcohol burns. This is probably the most important factor for me. I would like to start off with whiskeys that have little burn, even if that means lower ABV. 

However, I LOVE deep rich powerful flavors. Woody, smoky, earthy, spicy, the more the better! I feel like these are two opposites in my limited experience, the deeper the flavors, the more burn. The sweeter and smoother the flavors, the less burn. Is there such a thing as powerful, deep flavors with minimal burn? 

I live in the U.S. if that matters. Also, for example, I once tried Del Bac Mesquite Smoked Whiskey, and it was fantastically interesting. It tasted like bacon it was so smoky, and that's the type powerful, deep flavors I crave in a whiskey. Also laugh if you will, but I enjoy Fireball too. It has minimal burn, and at least is spicy like I am going for (but tastes way too sweet and obviously not a ""sipper"" drink). The problem with the Del Bac was it was almost so smoky there were no other flavors, and it burned like hell.

Hope I explained what I am looking for well, all suggestions welcome! ",19,2016-12-29 06:58:41

Price range: up to 120 dollars would be okay, if slightly above would also be okay. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 

As always: stay thirsty my friends, 
Cheers!

Japanese whiskey has become very trendy recently so it has been suffering from some supply issues. As a result, it can be tough to find a reasonably-priced and tasty bottle. Nearly all Japanese whiskey falls into the ‚ÄúLight/Fruity‚Äù and ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù categories so the whiskies listed in those categories are suitable substitutions.

Pretty awesome community you guys have. Some buddies and I have been talking about doing a whiskey tasting and I was wondering if anyone has done it before and how it worked? Looking for help on both format and suggestions of what to try.

A few ideas:

On format, I was thinking I could compile my list of whiskey and ask everyone to sign up to bring one bottle that we collectively determine should be there. I live in NC so some of the rare stuff won't really be easy buys. I'm going to also encourage people to bring extra/more rare items if they want to share.

On what to drink, I'm thinking we could try a couple different styles (scotch, bourbon, rye, etc) and also was thinking it would be cool to match whiskeys with the same grain bill like OGD and Basil Hayden just to note the differences. One question I have is what is a suitable amount of bourbon to try? I've done beer bottle shares before and it's easy to put away 20 bottles of beer between 10 people but with whiskey, that's getting dangerous in terms of alcohol consumption. I would rather keep it classy and not a total shit show. Let's assume I'll have 10 people there.

Every time I want something badly around here, I am told the only way to get it in state is by special ordering a whole fucking case. No thanks. NC law doesn't allow many (if any) independent bottlers into the state stores and they rarely order any rare or limited items either. This would be ok if I were anywhere near a state line, but of course I'm literally right in the middle of the state. The only actual question I have is are there any online stores that ship for less than master of malt? I like their selection, but unless I'm ordering over 200 dollars worth of whiskey at a time, it really doesn't make sense to pay that kind of premium for shipping (around 40 bucks).

My latest search has been compass box. I have called three counties nearby me now, all college towns with lots of working professionals that should carry craft spirits, and I got nothing. I finally got on the phone with the guy who claimed to be the NC scotch aficionado and he knew all about the brand and said he had tried many of their whiskeys but told me it would be literally impossible for me to get it into NC short of buying through an online retailer.

Anyway, I hope you guys are not in NC and enjoying a great whiskey tonight. I'm heading to the store soon to see what else I can find.

Edit:  I never expected this sub to be this elitist and unhelpful.  Not only is age stated wild turkey out of my price range but as a novice I didn't know that it wasn't available in North America and  only one user bothered to step up and fill me in.  I thought I was being trolled.  Sorry for wasting everyone's time, I'll come back once I have a bigger whiskey budget and a country club membership. ",25,2016-12-03 11:40:27

So i've been wanting to really get into whiskey ever since I had this one experience with an ""Old Fashioned"" (quotes because it had an 
orange peel &amp; cherry). 

-

Initially, the taste for me wasn't the tastiest, but it did leave a very interesting aftertaste/feel in my mouth so I was intrigued. Ever since that day i've had this craving to enjoy the taste of Whiskey but every time I feel like i'm missing out on what i'm really supposed to be tasting. 

-

Since having that first drink i've subscribed to a few of the whiskey/bourbon/scotch subreddits and have been reading up on the most common whiskeys that people use. One day at a bar I ordered an Old Fashioned with Makers Mark and It was actually pretty tasty, different from that first one but tasty nonetheless.

-

What i'm trying to ask is basically that i'm looking for some beginner advice into hot to fully appreciate the taste of whiskeys. Are there any ""Beginner"" whiskeys to try (besides Jack, not so fond of it) that may lead me to eventually appreciate the tastes of other whiskey? I eventually want to enjoy the flavor neat instead of on ice so i'd appreciate any and all advice to help enhance my experience.

-
On a side note, I enjoy cigars. One of my favorite experiences smoking was actually tasting for the first time Jacks Links Teriyaki. The flavor of the cigar and the jerky mixing together was amazing and since then Teriyaki tastes good, but better with a cigar. I'm hoping I can find some whiskey pairings to smoke with that would compliment eachother. Thanks all!",10,2016-11-08 13:07:21

However, somehow I have rather expensive taste and maybe I'm wrong on it? For example, I've never really liked the lowest shelf - Jameson, bushmills, jw or even jd. They seem to be overly advertised as majority of low quality product is, they seem to be so mainstream and honestly, I don't like them at all. Am I in wrong here? And with them, I'm not really a fan of monkey shoulder, which kinda counts as a bit better.

In early June I tried Bulleit bourbon/rye and fell in love with them. I also like 4roses, but it's lower than Bulleit. I haven't bought either yet, but in September I had an opportunity to get gentleman's JD, highland12, Nadurra rather cheap, from which I've opened first 2. Jd imho is no better than casual jd.

Razzafrachen,5crusj,105,whiskey,An Intro to Peated Whisk(e)y,"Peat seems to confuse and intimidate many so here's a quick intro to demystify one of the most contentious aspects of whiskey.

***

**What is peat?**     
Peat is partially decayed plant matter found in boggy terrain. Throughout history, people have dug it out of the ground, dried it then burned it as fuel. 

***

**How does peat relate to whisk(e)y?**     
A key component of Scotch whisky production involves germinating barley grains. Heat plays a vital part in this process. Peat was once used as a fuel source by some distillers to dry out their grains. While the grains were being heated by the burning peat, some of the characteristics of its smoke leeched into the grain which then got carried through the distillation/aging processes and into the final product. 

Nowadays, producers use more modern fuel sources to heat their barley but a few go out of their way to expose their barley to peat smoke to create a distinctive flavor profile.

***

**Which whiskies are peated?**     
The vast majority of whiskies &amp;mdash; including Scotch whiskies &amp;mdash; are *not* peated at all. Bourbons and Ryes are never peated or smoked. Irish whiskies are almost exclusively unpeated. In fact, the majority of Scotches are unpeated as well. If I were to walk into a liquor store and randomly choose a bottle of whiskey, I'd almost certainly choose a bottle without peat. By and large, when we talk about peated whiskies, we're talking about a small subset of Scotches.

The most prominent and well-known peated whiskies come from the Islay region of Scotland. Distillers like Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Lagavulin pride themselves on offering briny, smoky and intensely flavored scotches. However, a fair amount of delicious peated whiskies are made outside of Islay and can offer different types of peated whisky experiences.

***

**What does peat smell and taste like?**    
Firstly, not all peat tastes the same. Some peated whiskies can have an intense smoky flavor. Others can have more subtle earthy and vegetal qualities woven into the background. Other descriptions can include: heather, mushroom, rubber, band-aid, brine, leather, and sea moss. 

Sounds kinda weird, huh? It is... I'll be the first to admit that my own tasting notes make some peated scotches seem unpalatable yet I enjoy them immensely.

***

**Why I like peated whiskies**    
Some love peat at the outset, most ease into peat over time and some never develop a taste for it at all. All are perfectly reasonable and acceptable responses. However, don't shut yourself off from considering any peated whisky simply because it seems weird and unapproachable. I didn't love my first heavily peated dram but over time, I came to appreciate its unique and delicious properties. 

Here's why I enjoy peat now:

***Peat adds layers of flavor and aroma.*** Sweet scotches are great but offer a somewhat narrow band of fruit-centric flavors. Peat often adds savory layers of earthiness and smokiness that draw me back for another sip and help me appreciate the complexities and nuances in my glass. 

***Peat can have a deep, visceral quality.*** Peated scotch is one of the few beverages that can transport my thoughts to another place and time. When I drink Lagavulin 16, I feel as if I'm sitting in a leather chair near a fire in a stone cottage near the sea. Very few other foods and beverages have such a strong influence on my thoughts and feelings.

***Peat is unique and distinctive.*** I sometimes get a little burned out on sweet beverages - especially during chilly and wet weather. Peated whiskies offer an unparalleled savory and complex alternative for those times when you're not in the mood for a fruit and sugar bomb.

***

**Where to Get Started**    

Lightly/Moderately Peated:

* **Benromach 10.** A rare peated speyside. Mildly sweet sherried scotch balanced out by a touch of smoky peat and woodiness.
* **Highland Park 12 or 18.** This scotch has a little of everything including a nice earthy, vegetal background which leads to a complex and very balanced dram
* **Springbank 10.** Funky (in a good way). Its prominent creamy vanilla is balanced out by rich peat
* **Johnnie Walker Black** smooth and easy drinking with a wisp of peat
* **Johnnie Walker Green.** Has a bit of everything including subtle peat in the background
* **Talisker 10.** Peppery and salty with a backbone of peat. An appropriate gateway to the more aggressive Islay scotches.

Heavily Peated:

* **Lagavulin 16.** Leather, smoke and iodine. Beginner-friendly. A good place to start with heavily peated Islay style.
* **Laphroaig 10.** Beach bonfire
* **Ardbeg 10.** Black tar, smoke, brine. Delicious

RyanGWU82,5csd2r,4,whiskey,Can you help me understand what I like in a whiskey?,"After years of not liking Scotch, I've just started to get into other whiskey. But I'm a total newbie, so I don't really understand what attributes I like.

Here are some whiskeys I've liked: Bulleit Bourbon, Teeling Single Grain, Nikka 17 Year Pure Malt

And some I didn't like: Bulleit Rye, Teeling Single Malt, The Macallan 12 Year (and Scotch in general)

The Teeling Single Grain is my newest bottle. It burns as much as the Teeling Single Malt did, or even more, but I feel like it has a very crisp or clear flavor. The Single Malt seemed more complicated and I didn't care for the flavor.

I hear terms like peat and spicy and sweet and smooth, but I'm not sure if any of those are what I'm noticing. The only way I can describe the ones I dislike is that their flavor is ""too strong."" Can anyone help me understand what I'm actually tasting and liking? Any recommendations for whiskeys to try next?",3,2016-11-14 06:01:43

I am looking for crystal glasses to use for my ever-growing scotch and whiskey habit. I drink neat and also sometimes with stones/an ice cube depending on the label. I already have a set of crystal double old fashioned tumblers (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BSH3C2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_JmU6xb2S1A5ZS) that I use on occasion, but they are too wide for

EDIT: turns out the title was in all-lowercase letters. Oops.

Second: one summer night a few years back, my best friend and I enjoyed a bottle of the cheap but surprisingly wonderful bourbon Mattingly &amp; Moore. This is going to sound crazy, especially to all of you whiskey connoisseurs on this sub, but to date it is still one of the best whiskeys I've ever had, and by far the best cheap whiskey I've ever had. 

I picked up a liter for $20 and some change, and drank it on three special occasions before the bottle was gone, the last being when my friend came to visit.

Ever since then, whenever he and I buy whiskey (we were roommates last year and went on liquor runs almost weekly) we search for this elusive white whale. I've done a bit of Googling and learned that it's gotten much harder to find, but I don't think it's been discontinued. 

Disclaimer: I'm no whiskey expert. My go-tos are Old Grand-Dad Bonded and Evan Williams, and when I order Johnnie Walker at a bar, I always figure that if Red Label is good enough for Elliott Smith, it's good enough for me. 

Anyway, we're located in the Hudson Valley, NY, but make many trips further upstate as well as to NYC. If any of you are around those areas, and happen upon Mattingly &amp; Moore on the shelves, please let me know! I am hoping to surprise my friend with a bottle of this beautiful bourbon, since we've been searching for it for so long.

Thank you! This is a great community and I hope to stick around and do some reading up on your favorite whiskeys!",15,2016-09-28 10:03:02

ConfusedSinnamonRoll,5727kp,1,whiskey,Whisky noob: Could My Whisky be fake?,"Hello,

First time on this. 20 year-old whisky lover-wannabe. I've trying out a variety of bottom-shelf brands to just get my feet wet.

Recently got a bottle of Cutty Sark for real cheap at $48 and after like 4 drinks or so I was starting to wonder if it was fake.

I got too lazy to wash my glass last night and this morning I found purplish residue/light at the bottom. This has never happened before with any of my previous drinks. Is this normal?

The Cutty Sark label at the front isn't pasted straight, and there were some misc stickers on the back. When I tried peeling them off, it was obvious the gluing was sloppy. Is it just me being paranoid? I read somewhere that bad packaging tends to come with counterfeit goods. Or is this a thing common with even legit bottles?

I've read multiple reviews on Cutty Sark and the general consensus was its flavours were too light. However, I got a strong whiff of (synthetic?) alcohol the moment I opened it up. I'm not experienced on how bad fake booze smells, but it was certainly different from all my previous bottles. 

Also read that it basically had little burn compared to others. But this thing was harsher on my tongue and throat than anything I've ever had. Not sure if it's just my untrained palate or something else.

Should I just dump this and get a new one?

PS. Yea, $48 is considered dirt cheap in my country, taxes are incredibly high. This is an island where King Robert II goes for $52 and JW Black retails at $80++ at legitimate places. I got Teacher's at $56. Most places I scoured priced Cutty Sark at $66 but being the cheapskate I was, decided to visit this new website I found which had it at $48.

Now I'm regretting my decision.",10,2016-10-12 11:41:47

Yesterday I opened it. The taste was absolutely incredible. However the whiskey seemed to be stronger than the usual 40% while I was told during the brewing that it'd be 40% alcohol.

Anyway, is it possible to have a stronger whiskey after three years of maturing? The bottle hasn't been opened and the whiskey is unblended.",29,2016-10-12 16:05:25

But after years of whiskey drinking, I have slowly come to a place where I find myself ONLY wanting barrel proof spirits (100 proof minimum), and think that the majority of spirits between the 80-90 proof mark basically taste like water at this point, and I guess I just have a few questions for the community:

1. Have you had this experience? Do you find yourself on a quest to find the highest proof expressions available?
2. Are there any sub-90 proof spirits that you find as rewarding as barrel strength options?
3. Are there any barrel proof bourbons you can recommend? ",19,2016-08-30 22:16:09

TIA_Bru,51tuqd,52,whiskey,I recently went on a whisky tour to speyside. here are some photos,"http://imgur.com/a/zH9XM - Album of photos with captions

Figured some people might be interested in this if you are as enthusiastic as I am for whisky!

Over the recent long weekend we had in England, myself and 3 mates took a trip up to Dufftown/Speyside to visit some distilleries and do some tastings. there is more detail on the photos in the album but here is a summary of what we did:

- Cardhu Distillery for a tasting.
- The Macallan tour and tasting
- The Glenlivet tour and premium tasting
- Aberlour Tour and premium tasting
- Glendronach tour and a standard tasting. 
- Walking tour where we visited a number of local distilleries, most not open to the public. 

If I had to rate the best tours it would be:

1. Glendronach, our guide was a lot of fun and the distillery was not operating so we were allowed to take photos. 
2. Aberlour, felt like a smaller more intimate operation than the other big ones, the guide was great and the tasting excellent. 

Macallan and Glenlivet felt pretty standard as far as tours go.

Now if i had to rate the best whiskies (by distillery) i tasted on the trip it would be:

1. Glendronach
2. Aberlour
3. Cardhu
4. Glenlivet
5. Macallan

this is purely personal preference when it comes to taste. Glendronach just blew me away in terms of whisky. I had previously had one of their sherry cask strengths and a 1995 release so was keen to try more. their 21 year Parliament is fantastic, followed close behind by their 18 year and 12 year. I also got to fill a bottle of my own Distillery manager's cask which was my 2nd favourite behind the 21 year. 

Aberlour was also a great exposure, having only tried 1 bottle of their standard offering. they had 2 cask strength distillery exclusives that were excellent, one a Bourbon cask and the other a Sherry. 

One thing I learnt, if the distillery is currently operating, dont bother taking your camera with when you go inside as no photos are allowed. this was a bit dissapointing as when I visited the Islay distilleries they didnt care and let us take photos. 

hope you enjoy the photos, happy to answer any questions you might have. If anyone is every looking to take a trip up there im happy to advise on where we stayed and how we organised the trip.

I myself have had the 21, and I find it quite smooth, with floral hints being quite strong. It was also quite sweet, and the finish initially seemed to be really short, until I realised it was actually quite subtle. I quite like it!

Here's why:

* Bottle porn posts are showing up almost daily and removing them is very taxing.
* When these posts remain active for awhile, the community tends to respond positively to them. They most often net positive votes and get a few welcoming comments.

With that being said, we prefer posts that encourage discussion and participation. Keep in mind that many here have already seen a wide range of bottles either on store shelves or in their own liquor cabinet. So it's not especially novel to see them again in a reddit post. /r/whiskey will be a much richer place when community members prompt discussion and introduce provocative ideas. Why did you feel compelled post these particular bottles? What do you like about the bottles you're posting? Does a bottle have a special meaning to you?

We encourage *any* community member to enrich any post with discussions and ideas. This community will only be as good as the individuals who subscribe and participate. Don't look to others to make this place better. The more value you personally add, the better this place will become.

SheenaTheParasite,4x2cl7,10,whiskey,I'm looking for a particular whiskey,"My dad one christmas received a bottle of whiskey (i cant remember who from). It was a square bottle with a fairly short neck, there wasn't really a design in the glass. Square body, very short neck.

Im not holding out much hope for a result here. As I don't have anything close to a name. So all I can do is describe it. No worries if no one can help, but hopefully there are some fellow brits here who know a bit more about whiskey here than me.

It didn't really have a label on it. It's name and alcohol percentage were written/drawn on in white, probably the reason i don't know the name.

The whiskey itself was a single malt, a very pale golden colour (not far off from being clear), and the bottle was probably about 45/50cl.

I'm from the UK, so I feel like it will be a small independent company, and on the balance of probability from Scotland.

I know I could ask my Dad what it was, but I'd like to try and find it and give it him as a nice a surprise.

Struggling with searching the internet which that fairly vague description, and short of going home and searching through the cabinet for it, I don't have a any way of getting it's name.

Tomcfitz,4x4pta,0,whiskey,Captain Don's Whisky Review,"So, first of all, this is a strange and mysterious whisky, unlike any I've ever tried, and if you can find it (I'm not sure it's available in the states) you should definitely try it.


So, Captain Don's whisky is made in a small distillery here, on the island of Bonaire. Bonaire is a small island off the coast of venezuela, one of the ABC islands, in the netherlands antilles. Their only two industries are sea salt and tourism, centered around their status as some of the best scuba diving in the world. Approximately 19,000 people live on the island, which is only about 50 kilometers long at the longest points. 


Anyway, the whisky is made from corn, rye, and sorghum, which gives it an oddly sweet taste, balanced by the rye's spice. It is matured in new oak casks, with tobacco leaves added, which also balanes the sweetness with a smoky, lingering aftertaste. Id give it a 92 out of 100, its delicious, and novel enough that any shortcomings are overshadowed by the sheer uniqueness of the flavor profile. It's what the Balvenie Carribbean Cask wishes it was. Im excited to try this again with my pipe as well.

Nose:

A bit young, this is not an old whisky. Id estimate 2ish years. Elements of sweet oak and frankly an indescribable maybe... Molasses sort of thing going on. 

Palate:

Smooth, at only 80 proof, it doesnt have much bite, and none of the oilyness im used to with some scotches. It also somehow avoids all of the harshness in the nose, becoming a delicious summer whiskey, while the raw tobacco flavoring gives it enough body to satisfy on a chilly winter day.

Finish:

Pure tobacco, similar to a pipe. None of the sourness of a cigar, though, and with just enough lingering sweetness.",2,2016-08-11 06:08:10

I know very little about whiskey and spirits in general. My friend however does enjoy them quite a bit and wanted to get him a special bottle for the grad party. I guess since he got his doctorate, I wanted to get him a more special bottle than normal and I guess that's where my question comes in.

 I know he likes crown Royale, and other Canadian whiskeys if that is any help in any recommendations you can give me.

 Again, I appreciate any advice for special bottles to look out for. I know he hasn't had the more premium whiskeys crown Royale has come out with or Canadian whiskeys that can be considered ""premium"" and if anyone could point me to those that are considered highly rated, generally, that would be great.

desertwanderer82,4q1sp3,6,whiskey,New to whiskey...where to go next?,"Long story short, I'm a recent ex-mormon in my mid thirties who just took up alcohol for the first time a few months ago. Initially it was a big scary world I knew next to nothing about, but I'm trying to slowly learn. I've mostly been exploring craft beer, and have just started to explore whiskey. What I found with beer was that initially I found it most helpful to try many different styles more than trying different beers within the same style. That exposed me to the wide variety of tastes, and now I'm learning to appreciate the more subtle differences within each style. Would a similar approach be good for whiskey, or should I just explore one type of whiskey (bourbon, rye, scotch, etc.) in some depth first? 

So far I've only tried Jack Daniels (once in a mixed drink) and Jim Beam white label, both neat and on the rocks. I've enjoyed both, and really like the woody and smokey flavors, but I do think that the Jim Beam is awfully sweet at times. What might be a good next step? Should I try another bourbon or should I branch out to something different? Any specific recommendations that I could find readily and wouldn't break the bank? 

Thanks!",23,2016-06-27 13:33:50

Razzafrachen,4qc3yg,77,whiskey,PSA: Jack Daniels is Bourbon,"Jack Daniels is both a Bourbon *and* a Tennessee Whiskey. To put it another way, Tennessee Whiskey is a type of Bourbon.

&gt; The product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight bourbon, though the company disavows this classification and markets it simply as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon. As defined in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Tennessee Whiskey is classified as a straight bourbon authorized to be produced in the state of Tennessee.

x_Gr1M,4qmnst,12,whiskey,I tried my New Favorite Whiskey Last Night,"So I've only been dabbling for a year and a half or so, figuring out what tastes I like and what I never want to taste again. At the beginning of my adventuring, I tried a bottle of Bulleit Rye, and quickly fell in love. It was on sale though, so I don't often have it in my collection, and I would also go through it much too quickly because I love it. 

My grandma and I always used to trade our favorite alcohols, and shortly before she passed earlier this year, she bought me a bottle of Wild Turkey Rye, that I just can't bring myself to finish. I also found that I really, really like this one, but it's not quite as drinkable. 

I was out last night because I got out of work early, and I always sample the whiskey at one of my local bars. They have a pretty large selection, so I figured I would go in and try a few new ones once or twice a month. Last night, I went for comfort with some Bulleit, and then tried a dram of the Whistle Pig Straight Rye.

At first sip, the higher proof was slightly over powering of the flavor of the drink. I put just a few drops of water in, and I have to say, this is my new favorite whiskey. I checked it out, and the bill is apparently 100% rye. The mouth feel was just thick enough that I didn't feel like I was drinking water, but I wasn't drinking anything syrupy. The taste was full, a little spicy but still sweet-ish. Definitely a little vanilla and maybe some sweet nuttiness. I really should've taken better notes last night, rather than try to remember it today. Anyway, I really, really enjoyed it, and although it's a bit out of my price range at the moment, I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you enjoy rye. ",21,2016-07-01 00:43:53

dapperbastard,4sbysj,23,whiskey,"Is a scotch old fashioned (blend, not single-malt) really heresy?","I'm still learning about whisky, and figuring out my own palate. I've had a number of bourbons, and have yet to try one that jumps out to me even as much as the most boring Scotch I've tried (Tomatin 12). My local is a bourbon-focused ""whiskey bar"" gastropub. With that background:

I recently had an Old Fashioned at my local. They use Four Roses single-barrel in all their bourbon cocktails; and it was just too syrupy and ""mulled-cider"" for me. A few days later (about a week ago) ‚Äî after I described what I liked and didn't about it ‚Äî one bartender recommended I try it with a blended Scotch, and I picked Monkey Shoulder, because I'd heard it was a good blend; and didn't look ""too expensive for mixing"" (in fact, it's on their list as a $6 pour, to the Four Roses' $7). She made the drink, and I really enjoyed it.

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm there for lunch with my gf, at a table this time, not the bar. I order an ""Old Fashioned with Monkey Shoulder"". The waitress comes back and tells me the bartender is wondering why I don't want it with Four Roses. As I start to explain to her, he walks up (a different bartender than the one that first recommended the drink to me).

He starts asking me why I want it, I tell him the same thing, and he interrupts to explain that Scotch in an Old Fashioned ""will just taste messed up"". I ask him what he recommends, as I'd like a Scotch cocktail, and he hems and haws, and eventually recommends that ""A Manhattan with Scotch is okay. It's called a Sidecar.""

I was pretty sure that's not how I've seen Sidecar defined, but I went with it. The drink was good, and definitely (as those of you playing along at home are already saying) a Rob Roy.

But is a Scotch Old Fashioned really such a heresy that the bartender needs to come over and talk me out of it? I've been looking around, and while it's not the _most_ common variation on an Old Fashioned, it has its share of liquor columnists recommending it as a particularly good drink.",43,2016-07-12 00:59:55

* Mackmyra Iskristall
* Suntory Yamazaki 12
* Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt

* Nikka Coffey Malt
* Aberlour A'Bunadh batch 52
* Mars Komagatake 2011 (Sherry And American White Oak)
* Lagavulin 16
* Lagavulin The Distiller's Edition

**Impressions** 

**Glenlivet Founder's Reserve:**
The colour is a rather intense yellow/amber. Nose is very unremarkable, vague hints of oaky vanilla. It starts with a sharp burn in the mouth and ends with a peppery burn when swallowed. Mild spice flavour. Dislike it, would not even date - swipe left on Tinder. 

**Glenlivet Founder's Reserve modded** with one of those scorched oak sticks for about 6 months:
The colour difference is striking when compared with the 'unmodded' version. The whiskey here is a striking orange. The nose is rich and woodsy, lots of oak, vanilla and perhaps a tiny hint of smoke. Flavour-wise you still have spice, but now you get a large dose of vanilla and honey on the tongue. Smooth burn when swallowing, moderately long finish. Much improved and surprisingly smooth to drink, excellent dating prospect. Would recommend trying this proces with whiskey you can't stand, leave for a couple of months and see what happens. No loss, right?

**Mackmyra Iskristall:**
Bright golden colour, with a sweet/fruity smell mixing with the wood aroma. Liquorice flavour, unexpectedly delightful, rather sweet and ever so slightly glue-y. Moderate to long finish, very smooth burn. A plus plus recommended, except when you dislike liquorice. Quirky Swede, would definitely last in a long-term relationship.

**Suntory Yamazaki 12:**
Golden-orange in tone, nose is fairly strong, with sweet/glue and wood aromas. Tastes less sweet than you would expect, a lot of oak there too. Fairly strong burn when swallowing, moderate finish and you are left with some more oak and a little black pepper. Nice. Would date.

**Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt:**
Amber colour, great nose, lots of iodine, caramel and vanilla. Mild burn in the mouth, more iodine and pepper when you swallow. The finish is long, with less pepper and is rather smooth. Great for a NAS! A bit young, but would would not feel too old dating this one.

**Nikka Taketsuru 17:**
My personal treasure with a lovely amber colour, slightly more intense than the NAS. The nose is warm and spicy, with a hint of citrus. Palate is smooth, with a mild burn in the mouth and peppery at the start of the after-burn. Not nearly as much caramel here and the hint of citrus is a lovely surprise. Husband, but soon to be ex (since my bottle is almost empty).

**Nikka Coffey Malt:**
Golden colour, with a surprisingly fresh smell. It has got wood, but has a citrusy and sharp smell. Flavour is mostly caramel, I didn't get any citrus on my palate, but rather sharp. Short to moderate finish, not very smooth. The nose on this whiskey is incredibly interesting, flavour is good. Thinking about buying this myself. Husband material, but it will not be a long marriage. 

**Aberlour A'Bunadh batch 52:**
A deep red-orange in colour, it's quite sharp on the nose (60.5% alcohol). Otherwise some cinnamon and sweet dried fruits in the nose, warm and spicy. Taste is quite sweet, with some more cinnamon. Long and quite sweet finish, dry mouth after. That oloroso finish is interesting, good for dating some time.

**Mars Komagatake 2011 (Sherry And American White Oak):**
Amber colour, pepper with some serious glue and wood in the nose. Peppery palate, with some barley flavour. Expected it to be sweeter or with more vanilla, was not very sweet at all. Want to try this one again, needs a second impression. Needs a second first date.

**Lagavulin 16:**
Golden-orange in colour, smells of smoke and iodine (and the man of my dreams). Lots of flavour, lots of woud and a fair amount of iodine. The finish is moderate, quite smooth, still with more iodine. Would absolutely date this one, not sure about marriage.

**Lagavulin The Distiller's Edition (16):**
Golden-orange, with a mildly smoky nose. Also mild smoke on the palate, rather smooth and a lot of wood. Moderate, still slightly smokey finish. The more mild-mannered second cousin to the Lagavulin 16. Would date, no marriage.

Everyone agreed the modded Glenlivet was very interesting. I was not very fond of the Mars, but the rest of the group rather liked it. The Aberlour and the Taketsuru 17 were liked a lot by most of us. ",2,2016-07-12 02:17:52

Arrived, and the table wasn't ready.  So we sat at the bar.  I looked up and straight at a shelf of Van Winkle 12, 15, 20, &amp; 23.

If I remember (and heard) correctly, pours on the 15 were $50 and $70 on the 20.

What is this world coming to?  Worst part of it is I was tempted to try the 23 just to see what all the hype is about.

Had some Blanton's instead for more like $15ish.  

I checked and most of the pours and talk of Pappy 23 are a year or more old at this point.

I would prefer not to spend more that $150 on a bottle, but I would be willing to flex on the price if I need to. Yes I'm willing to spend $150 or more on a joke. I was going to get a Macallan 18, but they discontinued the 375 ml.

thefourbarrels,4nhxbm,11,whiskey,Review of the Highspire Whiskey - Made with Pure Rye,"If you are like me, you love a good rye and recent additions to the market have not failed to impress.  From the 110 proof Pikesville from Heaven Hill to the various offerings from Smooth Ambler, there are numerous products on the market to satisfy your taste and price point.  In order to fulfill demand for rye, we are now seeing a multitude of ‚Äúyoung‚Äù whiskeys on the market.  Initially, I was scared to drop good money on the Willet 2 year product but I am sure glad I did.  I have to say the mellowness and flavor coming out of that bottle is truly impressive.  The Willet 3 year rye has not disappointed either.  In the spirit of appreciation for these under-aged products, we submit this review of Highspire 6 month Rye.  


Coming out of Kentucky Artisan Distilleries in Crestwood, KY, Highspire comes in at 80 proof after being finished in wine barrels from Austin Hope Winery in California for 4 months.  The attractive bottle comes sealed with blue wax.  I must say that once I poured myself a shot, I certainly did not expect as must color to have been extracted from the barrel in the brief time it spent while at-rest.  It had a nice brown hue.  Not nearly as red hued as your typical sipper but still appealing.  Similar to its more-aged brethren, this 100% rye whiskey was extremely floral but with a sharper nose often refined by 4+ years of aging.    


The flavor was immediate.  Reminiscent of a flavor-forward reposado tequila, this whiskey covered the palate with floral and red berry notes.  Due to its youth, the sharp flavor did not evolve or develop throughout the tasting.  It is not overly complex but it definitely suggests that this juice will soon develop into something more refined and flavorful down the line. 

I rarely mix my whiskey but I wanted to see how this rye would interact in a cocktail.  I muddled my first peach of the season, some mint, lime and a bit of sorghum in a mug, poured some Highspire and let it mingle for a few minutes.  I shook the mix with ice and strained into a new iced highball and topped with a splash of soda.  It turned out to be a pretty good cocktail.  The complexity of the sorghum countered the youth of the rye.  The juicy peach complemented the fruit forward notes and the herbal flavor of the mint softened the sharpness of the spirit.


At this level of aging, Highspire is better served within a cocktail to complement its flavor profile.  There certainly are some things to be excited about if this label continues to provide ryes with a bit more age.  Coming in at a price point of approximately $45, they are churning out a decent product now but should soon develop into something special. ",3,2016-06-11 03:12:37

Dr_Bitcoin,4nk6km,12,whiskey,My bourbon changed flavour and got more 'burn'?,"So I love all types of whiskeys, but the whiskey I am talking about is Jim Beam Distillers Masterpiece - http://www.jimbeam.com/en-us/bourbons/distillers-masterpiece

So, I've had the bottle since October 2015, it's currently half full. I usually drink a shot, or two every couple weeks obviously not to often since it's half full. I like to save it and only drink it to have it for a long time.

Well today, I poured myself about a shot in a glass and when I went to sip it the flavor seemed off, and more of a burn I noticed it immediately? It is not because 'I haven't drank in a long time', I usually drink whiskeys all the time, but this is the one I drink not as much. 

The bottle is usually set on the top of my cabinet away from the sun, but maybe for the last 1-2 months it's been sitting on my counter and it's possible the sun has been able to hit it every now and then but it's not hot in the PNW anyways.


Am I just going crazy or can the flavor change and have more of a burn? It use to be much smoother to drink. It's on of my favorites and I don't want to have to waste the half bottle :(",10,2016-06-11 13:03:16

I would like to spend somewhere in the $20 to $40 area on a fifth. Right now I'm thinking Johnnie Walker Black Label Scotch because he has always been a fan, but it just kind of seems boring.

angled_musasabi,4obkcj,13,whiskey,"Cut with a bit of water, and it 'settles'? And, spices?","After 29 and a quarter years of not drinking, I decided to go with whiskey as a first pursuit a couple of months ago. Neat at first, then slightly cut depending on the proof, and with a few different scotches, a handful of bourbons, and one or two rums thus far. That's just a paragraph's way of saying: these are noob questions. =)

I tend to cut my doubles with just a cap full of mineral water. I know the two separate when left to sit, but I've noticed something else. If I take a good 40 minutes to consume my beverage, or leave it sit for 15 minutes before I take the first sip, the effects of the alcohol on the nose and the palate seem to be entirely gone, without so much as a swirl. What's that about? Is it just evaporating that quickly?

In another vein, I'm wondering about flavor. The first thing I bought was a bottle of Maker's, and it was alright. Recently, I had a bottle of Woodford and a bottle of Jura Superstition. I found the latter utterly bland and the former acceptable. Now I've got a Deveron 12 and a bottle of Larceny. I enjoy both a lot, and it strikes me that Larceny has some extra roundness and sweetness going on.

Simply put, where does that come from? I feel some reservation toward the rums that are labeled as spiced, because something in my uninformed notion of things suggests that these spirits shouldn't get their flavor from elements added after the fact (hence why I have no intention of bothering with mixed drinks any time soon) but instead from aging and ingredients. Am I being ignorant about the manufacturing processes? Or is my preemptive purist persuasion in line with others out there? Haha.",14,2016-06-16 12:18:18

   Few months ago i have tried RedBreast 15 yo for the first time ever. I loved it. It was during a trip to U.S. Now back in europe I wanted to buy a bottle for my father as a gift, but to my surprise I can get my hands on two types of the same whiskey (?) or so it seems from the pictures.

If i look for it online i get to see two different (?) bottles and boxes. Online shops in UK have bottles labeled as ""Single Pot Still"" and a box having a black color and on online stores in other countries it says ""Pure Pot Still"" and the box has a red color. Shipping from UK is way more expensive and that is why i was looking at some other (more local) online stores as well, but then again i would like to get my hands on ""the real deal"" :)

I would love to order them both and see for myself which is which, or whether they are the same, but i cant really afford it at this time and would like to avoid a mistake if possible (since its a gift and all). 

Does anybody know if these are the same whiskeys just labeled differently, or is there any difference?

x_Gr1M,4coiju,12,whiskey,Just tried out my first whiskey bar!,"This place opened up between where I work and where I live a few months ago, and I've been meaning to check it out for a while. I finally got around to it tonight and it was great! They've got a [pretty decent selection](http://www.ironabbey.com/drinks.php?mid=3715), and since it was a Wednesday, I almost had a 1 on 1 with the bartender. I'm relatively new at whiskey, and while I know a fair bit, he really educated me a lot. I got to smell some of the stuff I had been interested in, and try a few drams that I'd wondered about. 


I wanted to ask your opinions now as well! :) The first single malt I'd ever had was Glenlivet 12, which I really rather enjoy. It's light, no smoke, pretty fruity, and very easy on the palate. The 15 was similar, and I tried the 18 for the first time this evening, which I also rather enjoyed. I have the Nadurra in my home collection, which I'm currently sipping, and also love. We talked about some of the differences between the distillery locations, what I already liked, and he recommended a few other things I might enjoy. I also tried a dram of the Highland Park 12, which was a little peated, and though I rushed through it a bit to try to let him close earlier, I also really enjoyed it. Do you guys have any recommendations for the next time I go?

I also mentioned to him that I really love Bulleit bourbon and it's rye, and he recommended Rittenhouse, Four Roses, and one other that is escaping me right now... though it might be High West.",7,2016-03-31 12:27:22

(1) How could people ""compete"" in this event? (For instance, they could try to rank them based on their aggregate score on some whiskey-rating website, they could order them by characteristics of some sort, etc.)

(2) Which whiskeys should I get? I don't want to break the bank here, so they shouldn't all be super expensive. I'm thinking one high end, a couple in the middle, and one just terrible one. But I'd also like your input here as well.

Unfortunately, getting a bottle is just not in the cards for me right now, but I've pre-ordered a box of the Pappy Robustos for Fiance and his groomsmen to enjoy on the wedding day while they're getting ready.

Now I'm totally out of my element because, while I enjoy a good whiskey, I've never smoked a cigar.  I'm not sure if the cigars I bought would clash with certain bourbons or with a nice scotch.  I was thinking of going with a Balvenie 12 or 15 yr because I know he really enjoys them (it's his drink of choice for big occasions like promotions).

But because bourbon is our go-to, I was also thinking a Bookers or Blanton's might be nice (neither of us have had Blanton's, but we've heard good things and have been eying it for a while).  I'm also open to other recommendations!  I just want to find a really nice pairing, preferably under $150.  And preferably something that isn't a unicorn, like Pappy.

I'm not rich. Therefore I do not have money to throw around and spend wildly. This however puts me in a great position to maximize spending and focus more on quality than marketing.

I actually really love blue label. I'm the biggest skeptic you'll ever meet but through marketing magic or maybe it's really that good, I do not feel any bite after each sip. Also, thanks to the placebo effect, I do not get a hangover the next day from a night of blue.

Are there any alternatives that you guys recommend? Preferably at a lower price point (maybe $100 maximum for 750ml or 1L) that tastes just as good sans marketing mark up? Closer to $50 is even better for a bottle. 

I feel like Macallan used to be a hidden gem but lately it feels like they're going to become the new Johnnie Walker where marketing trumps taste.

Neversafeforlife,4e6yr5,25,whiskey,Whiskey FAQ's.,"I'm starting the guide, figured we'll start here. If I'm missing anything or you'd like to put the answers into a more eloquent form please do so below. 

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/Whiskey FAQs**

Q: Whiskey or Whisky? 

A: Completely interchangable. In general Scotland and Canada use whisky, America and Ireland use whiskey, but there are some that go against the grain. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: I have an old bottle of Canadian whisky, is it worth anything? 

A: 95% of the time this is a big no. Unless you have something from before the 1940's its probably worth $40-60. There are exceptions, but Seagrams, Crown Royal and Canadian Club are not these exceptions. Crown Royal XR red box (waterloo) is actually worth a bit of dough. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: I enjoy the lighter flavors, and a overall smooth whiskey. Make a recommendation?

A: Generally Canadian whisky, Irish whiskey, Highland Scotch, Japanese whiskey and a few others are on the softer side of things. There are exceptions in every category, so make sure to read some reviews beforehand. 

There are also lighter bourbons like Weller and Blantons if you want to go that route. 



&amp;nbsp;

Q: What kind of glassware should I use? 

A: The glencairn is the most popular glass among the whiskey crowd at the moment, its large bulbous bottom allows the spirit to breathe and concentrates these aromas near the smaller opening. 

The NEAT glass, copitas and wine glasses are good as well, but by no means necessary. Feel free to sip out of a rocks glass or even a dixie cup if you so desire. 

If you're looking to analyze scent, the NEAT glass is the frontrunner in this category. That is exactly what its been designed for, and it does its job very well.

 Glencairns would be my next choice, then a copita. The trouble with the NEAT glass is that its awkward to drink from, giving the glencairn the top spot overall for dissecting the flavors in your whiskey. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: Ice/ Water or neat? 

A: Personal preference. If its too much for your palate to handle I'd certainly recommend adding a few drops of filtered water. Repeat until you can drink it comfortably, add a mixer such as ginger ale, or create various cocktails like the Old Fashioned.  

 As for ice, it will dull your palate but you shouldn't feel the need to dissect your drink with every glass. It can also dull the heat from higher proofs, whiskies that have a heavy ethanol taste, or generally make cheaper whiskey more enjoyable. This hobby is about enjoying what you drink, so add whatever you want. Never listen to the purists. 

Ginger ale is a great mixer to use with with whiskey. It lets the spirit come through nicely while adding sweetness, a little spice from the ginger and dilutes the drink. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: What kind of cocktails/ mixed drinks should I try?

A: I'm going to keep this very simple. Visit /r/cocktails or google for a bazillion others. 

**Bourbon/ Rye**

* [Old Fashioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned)

* [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_\(cocktail\))

&amp;nbsp;

Q: Can I use mini barrels or staves at home to age whiskey?

A: Not really. The surface areas are too small and impart the flavors from the wood far too quickly. You're likely to end up with a very oaky whiskey without the nuances you'll get from a longer aged whiskey. 

Many people are using these to make aged cocktails, or adding wine finishes to their spirit with some good results. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: Does whiskey age in the bottle? 

A: No. Unlike wine it will not get better with age. Stored properly it will last alot longer then you will, but improper storage may lead to your whiskey getting worse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: How should I store my whiskey? 

A: In a cool, dark spot with the bottles upright. Hard alcohol will eat your cork if left on its side. 

If its been opened and you intend on leaving it sit for awhile you may want to consider using an inert gas to replace the oxygen in the bottle  to avoid oxidation. Any wine store will carry it.

It's 1983 pure malt glen grant scotch whiskey, with the original security tag still on it.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

azuled,4e9kt0,10,whiskey,Taketsuru 21: quick thoughts,"While in Japan I decided to try out a whiskey that I hadn't found available in the US very frequently (or at least not in my part of the us), the Taketsuru 21.  I had expected something like the Hibiki 17, which is one of my go-to favorites for Japanese whiskey when I want something different from what I usually drink (let's be honest, beer).

Quick thoughts:  It is a much bolder whiskey than I had expected, it has notes of peat and smoke, but more smoke than peat.  I don't think it would mix very well with anything, but neat it's a very delicious sipping whiskey.

The scent reminds me of Yamazaki, but I think that that is more to do with the general woody quality of both.

When I ordered it the barkeeper laughed and told me that it was his favorite whiskey from Japan (after I told him Japan provided some of my very favorite whiskey).  He described it as: ""very old, and very good"".  I think I agree.

Very much suggested, perhaps other American redditors will have better luck finding it than I did.",9,2016-04-11 14:32:40
Anterai,4eacrj,7,whiskey,"Some time ago I asked for advice, and here's a followup","Some time ago I asked which whiskey to get, Lagavulin 16 or Macallan 12. I asked for a mild whiskey that is interesting.   
Here's the linky: https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/48uld9/to_lagavulin_16_or_maccalan_12/   
And everyone told me not to get Lagavulin. 

So I listened, and went for a more mild whiskey. I thought about Glenfiddich, but in the end I've got myself a Hakushus Distillers Reserve (checked with this sub and people said it was great).  
But the other day I finally got my hands on a bottle of Lagavulin 16.

And here's the thing.  

Hakushu felt like water+alcohol. It had no taste. It burnt my throat and drinking it was far from a pleasureable experience. Not something I will suggest to anyone. Hell, it's worse than anything else I've tried.  

Lagavulin 16, which was hailed as a more rough whiskey, and something I should not go for as my first ""proper"" whiskey - felt so right. 
It had everything I wanted in a whiskey. It was mild, it was soft and gentle. The taste was rich, strange and strong. The aftertaste made me lay back and enjoy the moment.  
Out of all the whiskeys I've tried in my life - this one the best. It felt so right on so many levels that I cannot express. 

The taste was like an old fishermans rubber boot. And i loved every single bit of it. It made me appreciate a good whiskey. Argh, i love it.

Surely, I will give a try for Glenfiddich and Glenmorangie. But for now - I have to say that It was a mistake not to go for Lagavulin initially. For if i could afford it - that's the only whiskey I would drink.

And now, I'm wondering if I should go for different Islay's and postpone the Glens, or vice versa.

I tried Bushmills 1608 and its taste was very different from that of tullamore and Jameson. It's hard to find the words to describe it but Bushmills had this burnt Rubbery taste to it. Almost like a scotch maybe? Was just wondering if someone out there knows what I'm talking about and could give me a name to this particular note. Or if I just got a bad bottle of Bushmills. Cause I know Jameson is extremely smooth and relatively sweet and tullamore is very much the same(as far as sweetness goes) but with more of a burn.

But I thought, if I drink hard alcohol without wanting to get drunk, I may like whiskey. I am now for some weeks at my parents home, and saw a Ballantines bottle. 

I was about to try it but my parents are only keeping it for guests. So they know nothing about it. I have therefore few questions.


 - after the bottle is opened, does the whiskey loose taste? If yes, how long does it need?

 - I saw that you guys are adding water to it, how much? How cold?

 - Is Ballantines a good Whiskey? I mean if I find it horrible, is it because it is the vodka Jelzin of the Whiskeys or is it because I just don't like Whiskey?

Buffalo trace I liked very much - seemed to pick up on a  little more of a citrus flavor than others, definitely a keeper.

Crown rye, best thing I could say is that I appreciated how smooth it was.

Now, by chance I picked up a bottle of forty Creek barrel select.

SecretFedSpy,43gwpb,11,whiskey,So in the past two weeks my reaction to drinking whiskey has gone from the immediate desire to vomit to simply hating my life. I think I'm improving!,"Hi all,

So a few weeks ago I decided to start the long trek of trying to start enjoying whiskey.  I've gone through similar journeys with tea and coffee (much simpler obviously) and I decided that I'd love to be able to explore the different flavors of whiskey.  There seems to be a huge community around the drink and it seemed like something that I'd like to be apart of.  I'm most of the way through my first fifth (I've been drinking a finger or two every few days) and I don't absolutely hate the smell anymore.  I've tried a few different combos and I think splitting 40-60 with gingerale is probably my favorite combo thus far.  All jokes aside, it's encouraging to see that I'm starting to appreciate the flavor in very small ways.  I really like ""organic"" tasting drinks (something that doesn't taste like it's got a thousand preservatives or half a cup of sugar in it) and I can definitely tell that when I look past the burn (ooooh, the burn!) whiskey is just that.  

That being said, I'd love to hear what your favorite mixed drink involving whiskey is.  I figure it'll be good to try the drink in different ways and see if there are any particular combos that I like better than others.

So, needless to say, I'm a fan. With the main taste of the bourbon, and the touch of bitter-sweet brought by the other ingredients, it makes for a very tasty drink. I'm not usually into cocktails, but along with a Gin-Tonic, this is something I can sip all night. I'm just wondering why we didn't do this sooner... The guys in our party were all fans too!

I found a couple English websites that suggest it could be from the 80s, but the label emblem seemed a bit different (maybe because they are imports) so I wanted to ask you folks for a second opinion. The bottle is 2/3 full and there are are a few flakes of...something settled on the bottom. I'm guessing they are from the cork. The whiskey smell is weak but not unusual. Do you suppose it's safe to drink?

On Friday I will have some surplus money again and be able to get a bottle of something nice,and new. 

So currently I have tried Jack Daniels, which I cant stand the taste of, Johnnie Walker Red Label which is probably my drink of choice, and also Johnnie Walker Black Label which is also excellent but a bit too expensive for regular drinking. So,whenever I go to the liqour store I like to always buy a bottle of something I know I like,plus a bottle of something new and this trip upcoming will have me buying a bottle of cognac.

I really want to try a new whiskey and I was thinking of GlenLivet, based off the fact I dont think i like American whiskey (although I have been told that Jack Daniels is the budweiser of whiskey.) 


The only thing is which is kinda important,I cant really buy alcohol online where I live,but I do have access to a liqour store which is like the Walmart of alcohol. So,come at me with whiskey recommendations, /r/whiskey

CandyMan77,3zq829,18,whiskey,Review of Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye: Jim Murray's Controversial Pick for 'World Whisky of the Year 2016',"After some online hunting I managed to track down the hard-to-find Northern Harvest, who's hype has lead to a dearth of it at Ontario liquor stores.

I was extremely skeptical about it -- I'm not really a huge Crown Royal fan, and I'm particular about my ryes. But frankly, I was pretty impressed. You can read my [full writeup here, on Sublime Imbibing](http://sublimeimbibing.ca/crown-royal-northern-harvest-rye-worlds-best-whiskey/) if you're so inclined.

**Appearance**: Definitely a shade or two darker than Crown proper. Simply caramel colouring?

**Nose**: Great nose, WAY better than conventional CR. There's a nice balance of light floral notes, nutmeg, orange rind, and baking pie crust.

**Taste**: A very approachable dram of rye. There‚Äôs a bit of allspice and a hint of ginger, with a kick of black pepper to remind you you‚Äôre drinking a rye ‚Äì just without the aggressive bite. Norther Harvest also tastes of worn wood, sweet orange, and ‚Äì perhaps most profoundly ‚Äì like vanilla cr√®me brulee, with the toasted sugar and all. 

Finish: Long and sweet, with the higher proof adding a nice throat-warming touch.

**Overall, 87/100**. Not the ""World best Whisky"" by any stretch, but for $32 CAD a bottle, it may be the best rye under $50 in Canada.",6,2016-01-06 23:27:01

So I got home to search for a bottle and discovered there's [a bunch of hate going around on it](http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2014/05/orphan-barrel-project-shows-diageo.html). Basically the marketing is deceptive and their using buzzwords to market to whiskey nerds, and then there's [this](http://www.neimanmarcus.com/christmasbook/fantasy.jsp?cid=CBF15_O5644&amp;cidShots=,m&amp;r=cat24050744&amp;rdesc=The%20Christmas%20Book&amp;rparams=xpage%3D38). 

Definitely check out the video Neiman Marcus made on the $125,000 gift. It's pretty hilarious. 

Anyways, I liked the taste and I don't really care about the bullshit marketing or the image it gives whiskey. I'd probably buy a bottle if it was a reasonable price.

I just wanted to see what you guys thought about the drink and all that other stuff. It taste good to me but it was $25 a glass and retails for $140+.

It got so out of control that the federal government created a set of standards for whiskey and provided a tax incentive to producers that met the standards.

From wikipedia:

&gt;To be labeled as Bottled-in-Bond or Bonded, the liquor must be the product of one distillation season (January to December) and one distiller at one distillery. It must have been aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years and bottled at 100 (U.S.) proof (50% alcohol by volume). The bottled product's label must identify the distillery where it was distilled and, if different, where it was bottled. Only spirits produced in the United States may be designated as bonded.

[More info on wikipedia here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_in_bond#History_of_the_Bottled-in-Bond_Act)

The bottle cost me $5 more than a standard bottle of Jim Beam. Can't really tell the difference except that it is a little stronger. Cheers!",0,2016-01-09 08:00:42

He's been drinking whiskey for about 6 months now. He was is normally a gin drinker but when the weather started to cool he wanted something a bit more warm. 

I'm not a drinker. I don't care for the taste nor the effect of alcohol. But I do love my coffee. So I understand the different flavor and smells. Yamazaki is my favorite when it comes to smell. It's amazing. Everything else stinks like some sort of cleaner. 

So far he has Yamazaki (12 year) Hibiki (12 year) Lagavulin (16 year), and Johnny walker black label, oh and Makers mark. His favorite is Lagavulin which I got for his birthday last month. He's about 1/3 down already. I also picked him up Johnny walker but he doesn't seem to touch it much. This new interest is starting to get costly. Luckily the Japanese whiskey have been gifts from family over there. 

I'd like some recommendations to add to his collection.

I am planning on buying an oak barrel in order to age 70% pharmaceutical ethanol for a long time. Then I would dilute it with impeccable quality mineral water in order to get something close to whiskey. 
Since whiskey is distilled after the fermentation process isn't the type of grain practically irrelevant as long as the alcohol is produced from the fermentation? Aren't The aromas from
the grains during fermentation almost completely separated from the ethanol-water distillate? Is it worth performing my plan? 
All suggestions are welcomed!

Recently though (a few weeks), I can barely detect anything other than alcohol. Highland Park 12 was so difficult to drink and it smelled and tasted like it was some kind of oily engine fuel, in contrast with the first bottle I had (miniature), which was absolutely divine and magical.

Are they simply bad batches or something? But come on, all three of them (Johnnie Walker Black and Glenlivet Nadurra from the airport, and one miniature Highland Park 12 from a local store)?

Could it be the weather? This is the first winter for me in Scandinavia, and I've never experienced subzero winters before, let alone -20 and below. There really is nothing else that changed in my life, and I don't feel like my sense of smell has been compromised in any way.

**UPDATE:** the reason is probably the dryness in my room. Now that it's winter, the heater is on all the time. While I don't feel like the room is drier than before, other things suggest the room is a lot drier than it was before winter:

-My washed clothes dry significantly faster.

-When I used to bring in my laundry to my room in the summer and the fall, the smell of the detergent used to be strong. I would usually do the laundry in the weekend and spend most of my day outside. Now the smell is simply non-existent.

I am typically a bourbon drinker, but after a few glasses of scotch I might be having some doubts about my favorite pour. My go-to pours are usually Grass widow by Two James, Elijah Craig 12, and Four Roses Bourbon(yellow label). 

Last week I went to the bar with a buddy and we each had a Macallan 12 and a Glenlivet 12. I was blown away by how drinkable and sweet they were. Overall, I found them to be less aggressive on the palate( maybe because they are less spicy than bourbon?) 
Can anyone recommend some cheaper scotches to buy, or some bourbons that may share this quality?

I'm in Michigan, so prices are relatively high compared to other places. This website http://www.liquorli.st/ actually has prices of liquor in my state, and so far I've found them all to be accurate.

Somebody said:

&gt; Typically, Irish whiskey is known for its smoothness and subtle sweetness, and using bourbon, rye, or peated whiskeys would provide a subtle, but notable, difference in your coffee.

I don't know anything about whiskey. Irish whiskys don't use peat?

---

I used to use Trader Joe's Blended Scotch Whiskey. I bought it because it was cheap and once I tried Jameson I realized what I had been missing. I'll never use that particular TJ whiskey again. Compared to Jameson it was pretty damn harsh.

I really like Jameson but I still wondered which whiskys might work well.

From the other threads people recommended:

- Tullamore
- Canadian whiskey - the comment didn't specify a brand.

Also - would a more (or less peaty) whiskey be better in coffee? [How peat influences the flavour of whisky](http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/influence_of_peat.html) - there's a parts per million chart at the bottom.

APPEARANCE
Pale gold, like honey
Not much legs to it surprisingly, low viscosity

&amp;nbsp;

NOSE
Sweet and spicy

&amp;nbsp;

PALATE
A bit of sweetness and cereal, tangy citrus, finishes mellow and sweet like honey.
A few drops of water opened up notes of oak and pepper.

&amp;nbsp;

IMPRESSIONS

I stumbled upon your subreddit with a few questions. As you may have deduced from the title, I have never drunk whiskey before. Now that I'm legally permitted to purchase some, I'd like to know a few things. Keep in mind that I have no idea if I prefer malt, spicy, cloudy etc. as I can't distinguish between them yet.

Is there any way for me to find a whiskey that was distilled on about the same date as I was born? I'm 18 and I would find it poetic to drink a whiskey that was in a special way tied to me personally.

Furthermore, do you have a guide or FAQ? I'm on mobile now and I wish to be as well informed as possible to make this a memorable occasion.

My budget is approximately $70-100. However if you have a great suggestion that is outside of that price range please do tell.

I also need some glasses, are there any that you recommend?

Kind regards,

The Yoichi distillery continues to adhere to techniques such as the use of coal-fired pot stills, and otherwise remains loyal to the whisky-making traditions dating back to its foundation.""

APPEARANCE  
Amber

&amp;nbsp;

NOSE  
Herbal and fruity, apple and orange oil.  

&amp;nbsp;

PALATE  
Starts mildly sweet, banana and honey, peaty smokiness takes over, medium finish with a hint of spice. Feels thick, almost oily in the mouth.  
Adding water brought out more of the banana note and softened the smoke.

IMPRESSIONS

Nipje,3w29gb,11,whiskey,Question from a whiskey beginner relating to bad batches,"I have only recently started drinking whiskey. It took me some time but i am really starting to enjoy drinking whiskey at this point. I have tasted a lot over the past few months (scotch mostly) and currently own 2 bottles (The Naked grouse which was a gift and Highland Park 12 years, which is great). At this point, i would like to add some more bottles to my collection. For example, i have tasted Dalmore 15 years which i liked A LOT. However, something is withholding me from adding more bottles to my collection. For example, i went online to buy myself a bottle of Dalmore 15. However, in the reviews i noticed a lot of problems with the consistency of this particular whiskey over the past year. Consequently, i continued reading reviews for other whiskeys and noticed that in quite a few cases people are complaining about bad batches / bottles. To get to my question: is there anything you guys can recommend me regarding bad batches? Can i, for example, pay attention to information on the bottles that could indicate bad batches? Or should i pay attention where i buy the whiskey? I can imagine that bad batches just happen from time to time and that there is not a whole lot to do about it. If this is the case, how do you guys handle these situations?

Thank you in advance for your replies! Again: im still very very new to drinking whiskey so there is a lot for me to learn.",12,2015-12-09 19:32:03
Barrelproofcomedy,3w3vv5,23,whiskey,Review - Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye,"We just reviewed this on our podcast, I thought the written version would be more appropriate here. Minds changed on Canadian? What do you think? 

Jim Murray calls it a ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù and while we aren‚Äôt ready to go that far, we can say this:

Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye, with it‚Äôs light orange color, delivers aromas of baked Granny Smith apples and poached pears - like a pie cooling on a window sill in autumn.  Over time, the fruit scents give way to butterscotch with a hint a of bubblegum.  The standard Canadian thin texture provides a surprisingly velvety mouth feel. Explosion of flavor like Tidal Wave gum.  Dominant apple and vanilla mix with rye spice to provide a peppery and fruity taste experience.  Masterpiece or not, it is a damn fine whiskey - especially given it‚Äôs accessible price point.

Light orange in color
Baked apple and pear on the nose. Like a fall pie. Mellows to butterscotch and bubblegum.
Velvety mouth feel.
Explosion of flavor like Tidal Wave Gum.
Dominant Apple, Vanilla, Spice. Bright peppery flavor but wet and smooth.

I know that flights typically consist of a region and often progress in alcohol content, but the whiskeys I have range in region and country and differ from a single malt vs a blend.  What is the best order assuming that I don't open the Mizunara on this evening.  (I am going to save it for a special occasion). This would leave six whiskeys to try.  I was thinking of also printing out copies of tasting notes for us to use. I think it is easier to recognize the tasting note, if you are told what it is first. We are amateurs. Is there a resource to get consistent tasting notes for the whiskeys I have?  Maybe a website done by a single reviewer?

So I turned 18 a while ago and started to try out whiskey, I really didn't like to drink it and almost puked just because of drinking it.


However I really love the idea while drinkig whiskey, don't ask me why.


I just keep telling myself if I keep drinking it ( not too consistantly ofcourse I am no alcoholic ) I will start to like to drink it, just like coffee beer, wine etc.


What would you advice me to do?

What whiskey would you recommend me?

I would love to enjoy drinking whiskey because I like the smell of it and I would think that the taste would be good too but the taste of alcohol is just too much for me to handle.


Also I tried to add water and ice etc but didnt really solve any of the problems I came across.

Both Kirkland whiskey's are good. I've had the Canadian with ginger ale, and made old fashions with the bourbon last night. Haven't had them neat yet. The conventional wisdom on these guys is that they're solid spirits for cocktails, but many don't like them neat or by themselves on the rocks. They're nice in cocktails, but will have a few glasses neat in a couple days to try them out.  

I haven't, however, opened or tasted the IW Harper or Old Weller Antique. Frankly, I know nothing about either bourbon. What're your thoughts on them? Both seals are unbroken, and both bourbons were bought around ~1978, according to my uncle, although I couldn't find any sort of date on either bottle.

It had been years since I touched a drop, and at a certain point, I decided I would start drinking whisky.  
I cracked my first bottle on Halloween. I've had a glass each night since.  
In this short time, I feel like I've properly attuned myself to the taste and effect of my bottle. Obviously it won't be the same if I change drinks. I know this much. But even though I'm still a novice ""Man"", I feel like I'm qualified to hold myself to the high standards of the Gentleman Scotch drinkers of old and new.  
I'm currently drinking on a very cheap bottle (single malt?) from the local gas stop, but I'd like to move up to some of the higher quality Scotches out there. Unfortunately, I don't have the money to drop on getting buzzed. Normally when I'd drink, I'd go all-in.  
Though I haven't drank in a long time, I seem to process the alcohol just fine, barely managing a decent buzz most nights.  
I'm just curious to learn some more about the drink as I experience it, and you guys would help a lot on that path. I used to think alcohol in general was quite gross (not the taste, the entire everything.)  
I've never met a person I've liked while they were drunk. Even my closest of friends are absolutely intolerable when they're intoxicated. I'm coming to learn that doesn't need to be the case with this drink. In fact, it shouldn't be the case.  
Anyway, I need to stop this before I Twain the hell out of it. This is already three paragraphs longer than intended.  
Thanks for all of your wonderful replies!",8,2015-11-09 00:19:25

nerdpox,3s5u7q,16,whiskey,Buying a holiday gift for dad - need options!,"Hey guys,

So my father is a Jack Daniels man. Whenever we're at dinner he always orders it straight on the rocks, and it's the only liquor he keeps in the house. So I'm looking to purchase for him something a bit nicer along with a nice glass and some stones - for the hooch, preferably in the 70-100 dollar range, but I'm in a bind. 

Due to a medical condition I presently can't drink liquor, so I can't taste test.  I'm looking for something that is vaguely similar to JD in terms of flavor and texture so that Dad will actually like it. I know jack isn't super strong or fantastic quality but I figure since he drinks it straight he can taste it. 

So, any ideas? If it makes any difference in in the northeast and am fine with paying for shipping. Bonus for cool packaging or a cool backstory.

I know literally nothing about alcohol, but want to give my boyfriend a sampler set.","So, I've never had any alcohol in my life, and despite working in restaurants, I'm really clueless about what any whiskey terminology means. My boyfriend, on the other hand, enjoys a good beer/whiskey. 

Here's what I know: he likes his beers dark (I'm sorry... NO clue if this translates to whiskey at all) he prefers stouts or dark ales, he has a bottle of bourbon that his brother gave him, he refers to makers mark a bit, one time he and a friend gave a boss some Johnnie Walker gold/blue? (Not sure which) and he said it's good but not always worth the money. He likes dark rum, and he likes gin I think. He likes trying cocktails for new flavors, but rarely drinks whiskey in restaurants/bars, only at home. His default is a beer when we're out. He's somewhat the ""Ron Swanson/Nick Offerman"" type when it comes to food and drink. No nonsense, but likes the finer things. 

Anyway... A few of his buddies are going on a ski trip after Christmas and I wanted to send a box of whiskeys with them, but I thought it might be a good idea to do samplers? How much whiskey comes in samplers? It it enough that people could all try a little or is it kind of 'meh'?

petermal67,3sm6xl,2,whiskey,Has anyone imported a cask of scotch to the USA before?,"Lots of Scottish distilleries selling whiskey by the cask, they age it for 10 years for you (which is insured and guaranteed, if the whiskey is shit they'll replace it with as close a match as they have). 

It works out ridiculously cheap, for example Arran distillery offer 200 liters of whiskey for 1650 GBP. There's taxes and stuff you have to pay, plus bottling etc. Those are bulk liters, so it equates to around 215 bottles after the angels share and all that jazz, that's if you age it 10 years. Aging it longer reduces the volume.

I am **very** interested in doing this, however I haven't decided on a distillery yet. I'm currently living in the USA, and my buddy and I would like to go halves on a  cask. I just have no idea about importing it here, with customs and what not.

letgoandflow,3spf27,84,whiskey,"How to make a good whiskey sour, a drink I've become somewhat obsessed with in recent years","I'm sitting in my sister‚Äôs New York apartment on the Upper West Side, having a drink. Her three friends are there, drinking a bottle of wine.

The conversation dies for a moment and in a pretentious New York accent, my sister‚Äôs friend asks, ‚ÄúWhat are you drinking?‚Äù.

‚ÄúA whiskey sour‚Äù, I reply.

With an incredulous laugh she exclaims, ‚ÄúWe used to drink those in high school‚Äù.

**Nah, you didn‚Äôt drink these in high school.**

There‚Äôs really two kinds of whiskey sours, the mixed drink and the cocktail.
The mixed drink is garbage. It features a store-bought sour mix that contains artificial flavoring and corn syrup. Aging women used to drink these in high school.

The cocktail-version of the whiskey sour is possibly the most underrated drink in all mixology (although it seems to be making a comeback with the resurgence of the cocktail genre). It‚Äôs a simple drink, consisting of only three basic ingredients (and water). When mixed properly, it tastes like fresh, boozy, creamy orange juice.

##How to Make a Good Whiskey Sour

**The Whiskey**

Whiskey sours are made with all types of whiskey. I go for bourbon and to me it‚Äôs the clear best choice. In terms of quality, I‚Äôve made sours with everything from Evan Williams to Jim Beam to Maker‚Äôs Mark to Angel‚Äôs Envy. If money is no option, go for the good stuff. Otherwise, Evan Williams does just fine.

Scotch sours are a thing and to me, not a good thing. So be careful with pricier bourbons that have the characteristics of a scotch (e.g. Four Roses). *Edit: Not really sure what I'm trying to describe here by ""characteristics of a scotch"". Maybe I'm referring to a strong flavor that doesn't go well with a sour (maybe it's oak?).*

**The Sugar**

The standard is white sugar, mixed with equal parts water to make ‚Äúsimple syrup‚Äù. Simple syrup stays for days, so make enough for a few days worth of drinks. I usually mix a half-cup of sugar and a half-cup of water and heat it over a stove until the sugar dissolves. Don‚Äôt let it boil and stir it to help the sugar dissolve.

There‚Äôs a little room to play around here. Brown sugar makes a darker syrup and a darker drink with different notes. There‚Äôs a cocktail bar in New York that makes all of their drinks with agave. Personally, I keep coming back to the white stuff.

**The Sour**

The standard is lemon juice, lime juice, or a combination of the two. I used to make my sours exclusively with lemon juice until my local bartender revealed to me that she uses equal parts lemon and lime juice. This intrigued me because her sour had a much more creamy orange flavor. Since then I‚Äôve been using 1 lime for every two lemons and I‚Äôm enjoying the same results at home.

The freshness of the juice is critical to a quality sour. Citrus juice will stay in your fridge for days, but it will never taste as good as day 1. I‚Äôll usually squeeze 3‚Äì4 lemons and 1‚Äì2 limes and keep it in the fridge for the night. If I‚Äôm drinking the next day, I‚Äôll use the juice again. After that, I‚Äôm opting for fresh juice. *Edit: A commenter shared that some people have looked into this and there is evidence that lemon and lime juices reaches it's peak about 4 hours after juicing.*

Strain your juice too. Pulp and lime seeds have no place in a whiskey sour.

**The Water**

If your tap water sucks, it‚Äôs going to affect your syrup and your ice cubes. Use bottled water or a brita filter.

Also, be wary of your freezer. Some freezers smell pretty bad and it affects the ice and ultimately your sour. Clean your freezer and buy some baking soda.

**The Recipe**

2 oz whiskey  
1 oz syrup  
1 oz lemon &amp; lime juice  

Put those in a shaker with a couple of ice cubes and shake well. The point of shaking is not just to make your drink cold and mix the ingredients, it‚Äôs to water the drink down a bit. Pour over ice in a properly sized glass. A highball or rocks glass works just fine.

**Bitters**

Sure, go ahead. Not needed in my opinion, but Angostura bitters seems to be the standard. Try mixing them in the shaker or ‚Äúfloating‚Äù a few drops on top.

**Egg Whites**

Sure, why not. Egg whites add a little body to the drink and a layer of foam. A half an egg white is enough for one drink. Add the egg white in before adding ice and give it a ‚Äúdry shake‚Äù (shake without ice). This helps the proteins in the egg form a nice foam. Also, pour the drink through a strainer or the foam will be excessively thick.

**Enjoying a Sour**

The drink might be a little sweet or strong when you first pour it. As the ice melts, it will hit a peak and then slowly become watered down. I enjoy all phases of the sour, but I‚Äôm a little more attentive when the drink is in the sweet spot.

**Not happy with the sour?**

Play with it until you are. If you‚Äôre too good for the drink, move to Brooklyn and drink wine.",26,2015-11-14 04:45:25

However, this year finances are kind of tight so I'm keeping it to $500. I usually get one of the fancy Midleton whiskies (like Barry Crockett Legacy), a few bottles of Green Spot, a few Tullamore Dew crocks, John Powers Lane, Redbreast 12 or 21, perhaps some Connemara.

However, I want to do something different this year and try some whiskies I haven't had before along with some that I have had. Of the list below I've had the Powers Signature Release and the Redbreast but haven't had the others.

* Yellow Spot Irish Whiskey Pot Still 12 Year 750ML $89.77  
* Powers Irish Whiskey Single Pot Still Signature Release 750ML $54.99  
* Kilbeggan Irish Whiskey 750ML $29.99

I've tried various whiskeys (Talisker, Jameson, Makers Mark, Buffalo Trace, Laphroaig etc.) but always seem to come back to JD. I bought some Gentleman Jack a while ago and I enjoyed it but found it a little peatier than standard JD, which isn't really my thing.

I have a birthday coming up and was thinking about buying some Single Barrel. Does anyone know how it compares to GJ and a standard bottle in terms of taste? If it's also very peaty I'll probably go for Buffalo Trace instead.

dontwanttosleep,3nl80d,6,whiskey,2Gingers Not Much Of a Review - but a Very nice Whisky. Explanation in Comments,"Had some visiting family over this past weekend, I put on one hell of a BBQ as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/3nknid/this_past_weekends_smoke_for_visiting_family/) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/CQsSU). One of the better attendies of this get together brought a nice bottle of 2Gingers Irish Whisky. I had myself a wee bit during the final preparations and then more than I should have during supper, and well before we knew it the 3 of us that were drinking Scotch and Whisky looked at the centre of the table to 3 bottles that were 3/4's consumed and only 3 of us drinking it. We all kinda shrugged a little, and carried on drinking and playing cards.

Id love to give a fancy review like many others have done on here on the products they have tasted, but to be frank I don't remember half of the drunk texts I discovered the next morning that I had sent the night before, let alone all the components of a good review.

What I can say is that I did very much enjoy the pleasant yet mild aromas from this whisky, it had a nice medium feel on the tongue and a very light finish. I do remember this from my first trying of it, but don't remember much after that.

As well as the 2Gingers, we had a bottle of GlenDronach 12, Bruichladdich Laddie Classic, and finished off a small amount of Glenfiddich 12 and Balvennie Double Cask.

Given that 2Gingers is a bit of a rare commodity in my region I will say that when given the chance to buy this ovely product I would do so in a heart beat.",3,2015-10-06 00:13:57

As the Guinness chilled in the snow, I tried the green Jack. Didn't know what to expect, but remember it smelling somewhat foul. Sipped it, thought &lt;sour face&gt;""my goodness""&lt;/sour face&gt; but had some more anyway.

Story behind: I visited the US for the first (and so far only) time in 2006 for the JD BBQ. The Green Label wasn't available in Germany (as far as I knew, today I suppose I was wrong). There's nothing at all special about it, but it is still a souvenir I won't touch.

She's visiting the Jameson distillery but also going to a few other bottle shops. I am not picky on taste but am looking for something with a very buttery texture, almost like motor oil, where it just coats your tongue. I would rather have something sweet or spicy as compared to being peaty and smokey. 

Some ideas I have are Bushmills 21, Connemara 12, Middleton Barry Crocket Legacy or Redbreast 21. But if there is anything I could only get there that has the aforementioned qualities, I would love to try it and review it. Cheers!",5,2015-10-19 02:28:27

The limit would be ¬£50-60 max per bottle

I typically drink Jameson but I'm a big fan of Bushmills Original and Black Bush but don't like the 10yr (it's too light, if that's a thing). 

I've also had the pleasure of trying Japanese whiskey on a recent trip and really like Hibiki 12 and Yamazaki 18 but for obvious reasons the latter is off the list. 

As for Scotch I'm relatively blind I haven't tried many but I do like Talisker but can't stand JW Black or Glenmorangie. Same goes for American aside from Wild Turkey 81 being on my avoid at all costs list. 

Would Redbreast 12, Tullamore 10, Lagavulin 16 or Hakushu 12 be good? Thanks for the help and recommendations. ",14,2015-10-19 23:18:06

I currently do a minor Entrepreneurship at the university of Amsterdam. A big part of this program is starting your own REAL business. With a group of four we came up with the idea to sell whisky made by small, unknown distilleries in Europe (Scotland, Engeland, France, Switzerland, etc.). We plan to not only sell a unknown whisky, but also tell a short history story about that particular distillery.

I was wondering what you guys think about it.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a good brandy glass in a balloon style to give as a gift to someone? I've had a look online at reviews and thought I'd settled on the Riedel Vinum Cognac Balloon glasses (84cl), but my partner has vetoed that based on a couple of reviews slating the quality/size of them. The Dartington Crystal Wine Master Brandy glasses (82cl) were my next best pick, but they are almost as large.

I know the person I'm buying for has good taste, prefers the finer things in life, but has asked for ""inexpensive"" glassware (although how they define that I suspect would differ wildly to me). I know they prefer the balloon shape, and they are fond of heating the glass.

Any help would be amazing, I drink whiskey, I don't like brandy and barely know what I'm doing, thank you!

Edit.
He specifically wants a balloon glass. I've read about how heating with anything other than hand warmth is a no-no, but it won't be me that actually drinks it. Looking for a pair of glasses which cost ¬£20-40 ideally. Won't be gifting brandy with it. Thanks!",22,2015-09-02 07:11:45

arcturusproxima,3fk59l,6,whiskey,Question About Crystal Decanters - Cleaning and Pre-leaching,"I like the idea of serving my finer spirits in a decanter set so I purchased one. The one i purchased is made from 24% lead crystal and as such runs the risk of leeching lead into my whiskey. Due to this I obviously have no intentions of long term storage of spirits in it but nonetheless I was curious if pre-leaching is a viable way to lower lead levels that may seep into liquids stored in it in general? 

I have my decanter set soaking currently in a solution of vinegar and water in an attempt to help reduce the levels of lead that may leach from the crystal into spirits. Does this have any actual effect or is it more of a snake oil treatment?

Secondly, what is the best way to clean crystal and give it that natural shine? I've googled around but get conflicting information.

EricandtheLegion,3frakl,15,whiskey,Whiskey Tasting Party Reviews (5 whiskeys),"This past Friday, I invited some friends over to try some of the whiskeys I got as a birthday present. Below is the review of each.

1) EG Reserve Crown Royal - This is my personal oak aged whiskey. I aged 2 Liters of standard Crown Premium in an American white oak barrel for 4 months. The result contained strong notes of oak and caramel with a slight maple sweetness both on the nose and in the taste. The nose also contained a slight smell of men's cologne. The abundance of oak and caramel completely masked the alcohol burn, but the alcohol effect was definitely present. My guests (and even my wife, a self-proclaimed hater of whiskey) thought this whiskey was incredibly drinkable.

2) [1792 Bourbon](http://www.totalwine.com/eng/product/1792-bourbon/99630750) - Notes of caramel corn, toffee, and baked goods on the nose. Very sweet and light. Made me think of the state fair or something similar. Tasted like sweet cornbread to me. My guests thought this was an incredible bourbon and everyone agreed it would be perfect for bourbon-based mixed drinks. My wife liked the sweetness and caramel notes, so she used this to make an Irish coffee-style mixed drink.

3) [Old St. Pete Whiskey](http://www.totalwine.com/eng/product/old-st-pete-whiskey/151193750) - A local whiskey from Florida. My sister lives in St. Petersburg, FL so she thought this would be a fun local addition to the tasting. Strongly fruity on the nose. I thought this whiskey had a strong floral taste. I have to give it a few more tries to see if I can appreciate it, but for now, this one isn't for me. A few of my guests had just one or two sips and turned down the rest. My wife couldn't stand it.

4) [Crown Royal Special Reserve](http://www.totalwine.com/eng/product/crown-royal-special-reserve/12109750) - This was used as a comparison for the previous three whiskeys. Seeing as how this was a more standard whiskey, it was easy for everyone to say X whiskey had more Y notes than Crown Reserve. Not going to bore you all with notes.

5) [Snake River Stampede](http://www.totalwine.com/eng/product/snake-river-stampede-canadian-whisky/104421175) - This was brought by a friend attending the party. He claimed it had too strong of an alcohol bite for his tastes (having only had one glass himself) and wanted to donate it to the tasting. He wasn't wrong. This whiskey has a pretty noticeable alcohol bite, almost rivaling that of a vodka. It has a little bit of a vanilla and oak taste to try and balance, but it falls short of masking that bite to make this a smooth whiskey. I'll drink it, but wouldn't buy it. My guests were not impressed (other than the two that like to get drunk on the weekends) and my wife nearly spat out her one sip.

Have any of you tried these whiskeys? Thoughts? What should I get next?",2,2015-08-04 23:41:30

**Color:** Light Amber, almost like Orange Blossom Honey

**Nose:** Strong alcohol smell intially. After that fades, it smells almost like non-maple pancake syrup. Maybe a little bit of black licorice? Also possibly banana?

**Taste:** Pancakes, banana, slightly nutty (maybe like those candied pecans from the fair), Nilla wafers even. Sweet but not too sweet. The alcohol bite is present, but not to the point that it shocks you.

**Finish:** I get a lot of butterscotch on the finish, possibly some caramel as well. Creamy yet salty flavors for sure. The banana stays a little bit too, but not for long. On the third or fourth sip I got this really distinct soft pretzel taste.

I've been reading other reviews for HSB. I saw one person get some Christmas-y flavors like cinnamon and nutmeg. Saw another reviewer get breakfast flavors. Saw yet another get kind of synthetic acetone flavors. I am so fascinated by the varieties of this whiskey. I think I lucked out though, I am really enjoying the kind of boardwalk vibe that I am getting. Bananas, caramels, soft pretzels. The sweetness fades to saltiness on the aftertaste really quickly.

I love the idea of whiskey, and when I hear a connoisseur describing its flavors I can't help but think about how delicious it sounds. I bought myself a bottle of Maker's Mark, after reading a lot of different people saying that it was one of the first whiskeys that they fell in love with. It smells fantastic.

I poured myself a small glass and tried to drink it neat, and while I didn't find the taste to be unpleasant at all, I felt like I was breathing fire until I drank something else.

I added a few drops of some filtered water, and it helped a bit, but ultimately it still left me feeling like I had a terrible case of heartburn in the back of my throat.

Any advice? I'd love to be able to sip from a flask without immediately having to drink something else to stop the burning. Is it something I just have to train myself to get used to?


EDIT: Thank you all for the advice! After I got off work today I poured myself a glass and added a few ice cubes, took a small sip, let it roll over my tongue for a while, and made sure to exhale directly after swallowing.

At 8pm eastern (8:30 pm for non prime members), a very highly rated (4.5 stars) 8-piece whiskey set will go on sale. 

It's $52, which means that the sale price should be no more than $40 (lightning deals have to be discounted 20%), but hopefully even lower than that.

If you are unfamiliar with lightning deals, basically, at a set time, products go on sale at at least 20% off. there is a potentially-limited, unknown supply, so if you find something you like, refresh that page right at the deal time and have your cart ready to purchase.

Here's a direct link to the whiskey set: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GXR21C

here's a link to the discussion thread at the daily deals sub that I run.

Psyberion,3gqecg,12,whiskey,Lids for glasses,"I've recently noticed that there are a few whiskey glasses which are sold [with a lid](http://www.whiskyandale.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alba-Whisky-Glencairn-Whisky-Glass-Glass-and-Tasting-Cap--1024x819.jpg) (mainly Glencairn it seems), or that there are lids available for sale. As I am quite the beginner when it comes to whiskey, I was hoping someone could explain the reason for having lids on your glasses?

Some obvious reasons come to mind, such as keeping insects or similar out, but something tells me there's more to it.

Thanks in advance!

johnnyarr,3guec1,2,whiskey,"Looking for a celebration bottle, description inside","So, more than a year ago, my friend wanted to drink a whiskey out of his price range, so he came up wit the idea that we get together and split the bottle to try it. This became the basis of Whiskey Wednesday. As long as we had 4/6 people free, we'd get together, split a bottle, turn off phones and TVs and just BS for a couple of hours and share a glass (or two..or three). We've now done 50 weeks of this! So why am I posting here? Well every week (roughly) we would each put a dollar into a box for the one year celebration bottle. You can see in the link below what's been rated highly and the styles we tend to enjoy more . Since most of our decisions are go to the store, look at the wall and grab what sounds cool without research, we're looking for a broader input. We'll be somewhere in the $300-$500 range I think. Check out the sheet here https://goo.gl/02eYmL three of us all subscribe here so I'm sure any sort of questions will be answered.

TL:DR; have lots of money for good whiskey, need suggestions",1,2015-08-13 20:48:02
WolfofAnarchy,3gvvo8,24,whiskey,Is Jack Daniels worth it? + whiskey recommendation?,"Heya, 19 y/o beginning whiskey drinker checking in.

I used to really love me some Jack Daniels for the smooth taste, it doesn't bite, and it has a nice rich taste to it.

UNTIL, I found on this sub that its generally seen as bad whiskey for the price? I'm from Germany.

There are many whiskeys cheaper than it, but I just want to know if it's worth the extra price.

Also, can you guys recommend me a nice smooth whiskey? I want it to have a taste that's not biting, but really one with a strong flavor of oak or whatever kind of wood :D.

I'm just a beginner, don't shoot me! :)

SlowRollingBoil,3gxeg8,13,whiskey,Getting frustrated when trying to find my type of whiskey.,"First, my budget is low. Like, $25 per bottle is the most I'd ever spend on myself and even that is too high. Realistically, $10-$20 is what I'm looking for. Maybe I'll have more money for this later in life but for now anything over $25/bottle really isn't in the cards.

Second, I'm trying to find my ""type"". I feel like I've had a good sampling:

**Bourbons:**  
* Jack Daniels  
* Evan Williams  
* Maker's Mark  
* Woodford Reserve  
* Bulleit Bourbon  
* Jim Beam  
* Jim Beam Honey

**American Rye:**  
* Bulleit Rye

**Canadian:**  
* Canadian Mist  
* Royal Canadian  
* Canadian Club

**Irish:**  
* Jamerson  
* Bushmills  

**Scotch:**  
* Glenmorangie Nectar D'Ore 12  
* Glenlivet 12  
* Glenfiddich 12  
* Cardhu 12  
* Dewars  

I'm sure I've forgotten some. But anyway, the point is that I can't really seem to lock in on what my type is. I can say that although I've enjoyed Scotch here and there, it really isn't my favorite. I can effectively wipe that off the list.

**Irish:** I had several Jamerson and ginger ales and they were delicious but my abiding memory was that I couldn't really tell that they were alcoholic. People talk about the smoothness of Jamerson but when I had it straight and on ice it wasn't that appealing to me. *I'd be interested in hearing about other Irish whiskeys that would be considered a true representative of the type.*

**American Rye:** I've only tried Bulleit Rye in this category but I enjoyed it more than Bulleit Bourbon. People keep saying rye is ""spicy"" but I never get this flavor from rye.

**Bourbon:** I've definitely had some cocktails with bourbon that I've liked but the corn flavor of it can get to me sometimes. Evan Williams, especially, has a very strong flavor profile (to me) and I like it for what it is but it's almost got too much character in comparison to what I'm used to. Which is...

**Canadian:** I've been a Canadian Club guy for quite some time. I enjoy it (and Canadian Whiskey in general) but I think it's because it's kind of bland. As many have said, it allows your other cocktail elements to overpower it. It doesn't have much going for it.

--------------

**TL,DR:**
I feel my ideal type of whiskey would be flavors of sweet vanilla, caramel and not featuring corn flavors heavily/at all. All for under $25. Thoughts?",51,2015-08-14 10:16:35

spirtof76,3hrsly,8,whiskey,Recommendations $60 budget.,"I was recently given a $60 gift card for Total Wine and was hoping for a spirt recommendation. I'm not sure if I like Scotch or Bourbon, I've pretty much stuck to one lane Irish Whiskey. I don't like it when its too peaty or too spicy. I found Knappogue Irish Malt 12 Yr and the description sounds really interesting. 

I'm open to trying something new &amp; seeing what else is out there. I was hoping to find something that is smooth and sippable. Would you suggest something else? Perhaps a Bourbon, Scotch or another kinda of Whisky?

Thanks in advance!",7,2015-08-21 05:46:03

ilovescotch93,3bz02q,10,whiskey,[Question] What are your favorite cheap Canadian whiskies?,"I'm a single malt Scotch enthusiast (Islays in particular), but for some reason, I seem to have cheap taste in bourbon and Canadian for my casual sippers, to be poured over ice. I tend to have bad luck when I buy something based on word-of-mouth recommendations or shelf appeal.


What are some of your favorite cheap Canadian whiskies and why do you like them? I'm on a budget at the moment and I need some recommendations. 


Some that I've tried:

Black Velvet 8yr - Decent, gentle, buttery and nutty. I like it.

Windsor - Pretty decent, actually. Nice and carmely.

Canadian Premium - Not bad, but less interesting than the previous two.

Canadian Hunter - Liked it at first, grew to hate it.

Hunter Rye - Not much better than the standard.

Ellington Reserve - YUCK.

Canadian Leaf - Tastes like someone took some cheap vodka and soaked a charred oak dowel rod in it.

Canadian Mist - It's okay, not great.


Some that I'm looking at trying:

You might get this question a lot, so sorry. I'm getting more into Old Fashioned(s?) lately and would like to start making them myself. I'm normally just a cheap whiskey and coke drinker (usually Captain) and would like some recommendations on a good, but starter whiskey to use. I was thinking about something in the 40-60 dollar range. I just don't want to jump right to the ""red wine"" of whiskeys without evolving my taste first. Also, is there a real difference in bitters, or am I good to just buy any brand?

ilovescotch93,3d8aux,10,whiskey,Why all the hate for blended whiskeys?,"So, first off, I'll say that my tastes in whisk(e)y are all over the place. I love to savor a great single malt like Laphroaig or Bunnahabhain, but I also think that some cheap blended whiskeys are pretty good. I'm actually not talking about Scotch, but blended Canadian and American whiskeys.


These tend to get lots of hate, especially cheaper ones from the States, but some are actually pretty decent (IMO) for what you pay. Like, even though some are as little as 20% straight whiskey and the rest neutral spirits, some of them still taste fine and aren't as horrible as made out to be. Kentucky Deluxe and T.W. Samuels are perfectly drinkable blends. Not as flavorful as a straight bourbon but still decent enough to sip. Maybe I just have cheap taste, because it takes something really, REALLY bad to make me wince, so I'll drink just about anything. I tend to have cheap taste in American and Canadian whiskeys and expensive taste in Scotch malts. But I mean, I can get a liter of Royale Club here for $6 and change and it tastes totally inoffensive, like bourbon but lighter. My girlfriend actually prefers blends because she doesn't like the strong taste of straight bourbon, and they mix pretty well, if not better than straight bourbons, IMO.


I really don't care if it's 80% neutral grain spirit as long as it tastes good. Don't see why that's a problem. It makes bourbon cheaper for us all anyway by reducing the demand for actual aged whiskey.


Most bars around me serve a variety of blends if you order a bourbon (without specifying a brand) so I've had quite a few and they're all decent. Most cheap Canadian blends I've had were meh, but some stand out, like Lord Calvert and Black Velvet.


So my question is... do you loathe, tolerate, or like blended North American whiskeys, and why so?

Mudkipz137,3duomg,5,whiskey,New here! Intro and a couple questions from a noob,"Hello /r/whiskey I'm somewhat new to the world of whiskey.  I grew up being exposed to gin and vodka primarily, and once I began drinking those were the drunks I gravitated towards.  A bad, early, learning experience with rum gave me an aversion to liqour that wasn't clear so for a long time I avoided whiskey.  (Yes, it's stupid but it wasn't a pleasant experience and I was young).

I decided to force myself to enjoy whiskey, I figured it would be an acquired taste. I used to hate beer, until I drank it for a while now I enjoy it.  Used to hate wine, now I love it.  Plus as I get older I enjoy trying new things. 


*My Break In Process*

To start I got a bottle of Chivas 12 year blended. I knew it wouldn't be great, but I hoped it was just good enough for me to get used to it.  It took 4 weeks for me to finish it, and while I was finishing it (1 finger every couple nights) a buddy bought me a 12 year Macallan.  By time I finished the Chivas, I opened the Macallan and I loved it.  I'm no expert I just thoroughly enjoyed it.  Now scotch is my go to, I love it, but it is admittedly expensive.  

The two labels I've been gravitating towards are Macallan 12 year (wife and I are expecting and don't have a lot to spare to upgrade to an 18 year though it's a dream for me to buy one), and Glenfiddich 12 year.

I like the Glenfiddich becaise at $30 a bottle it's cheap enough to drink consistently, but I still enjoy it.

The Macallan is my bottle I only open on occasion.

*Questions for you experts!*

1) What's other scotch labels you suggest?  Currently drink Macallan 12 and Glenfiddich 12, but I'd like to expand my tastes.  


2)  I'd like to try some non-scotch whiskeys, any recommendations?


3) weird question. I recently started drinking Jack Daniels as a cheap mixer drink for social occasions or when it's too hot to drink scotch.  I enjoy Gentlemen Jack but the Sour mix or whatever, the cheap Jack Daniels gives me a nearly unbearable headache before I can finish a drink.  have you ever experienced this? Why does it happen?  I don't mind the taste (with coke....and ice.... granted that's 2 key things to hide the flavor) but before I get halfway through a drink my head starts hurting.


TL:DR: I'm new.  Recommendations welcome.  Why does Jack Daniels give me a headache?

timeconsumerii,3dv6m0,10,whiskey,Thoughts on Elijah Craig barrel proof?,"Hey guys, new to this sub, relatively new to appreciating whiskey. I'm a homebrewer and I've been sick of the beer scene lately, so here I am. I went to a beautiful bar on Friday night called Sugar House in Detroit and had a glass of Elijah Craig barrel proof bourbon. Absolutely incredible. The color was a rich brown. Impressive oak nose, a bit spicy and oakey taste which lingered on the palate after swallowing. It seemed a bit hot, but not in a cheap way. Maybe that's a characteristic of being barrel proof. Anyway, I'm thinking of picking up a bottle but I'm having a hard time committing. Has anyone else tried it?",14,2015-07-20 04:02:03

So here is the situation, I have a bet with some friends that it looks like I am going to be winning. The winner gets to pick a single bottle of Scotch valued at $500 USD that the others will pay for. 

 I have been a lover of scotch for many years but I have never had that kind of cash to spend on a bottle of whiskey so I am looking for some recommendations for a bottle that is that pricey. 

The terms of the bet stipulate that it has to be only a single bottle unfortunately (I tried to talk the others into a few really nice bottles but was out voted on the subject). I generally prefer the smoother Highlands that tend to be on the sweet side but I'm not adverse to getting something with a smokey flavor.

I've always been a bourbon fan and thought he got me a really nice gift. I actually saved it for an occasion and poured some out neat and honestly didn't like it. It burned like hell (no smoothness at all) and didn't smell like bourbon or really taste good at all. Of course, I lied to him and said it was awesome. It was a gift and didn't want to hurt his feelings. So we get to last night and my friend buys a bottle of Heaven Hill and it really reminds me of the Four Roses SB. He proceeds to laugh at me and remember that a year ago he pulled a prank on me and actually poured Heaven Hill into a Four Roses bottle his roommate had and that is what he gave to me!!!

I am far from a whiskey aficionado, but it is my father-in-law's birthday this Sunday and he loves it. His go-to in most instances is Stranahan's. 

I'm hoping this group might be able to help me find something that's close to this straight whiskey but help FIL expand his whiskey horizons. From my understanding, Stranahan's is aged in oak barrels with the final being a blend of a couple different ages. That's about all I'm familiar with. I wish I had some specifics on why he likes it, or what about it he likes, but I don't! I'm hoping with the knowledge here I might find something comparable, but different enough.

Price range I'm looking for $60-$100.

I'm based in Philadelphia and found a few bottles online for $375. I was going to counter with $325-- do you think people will laugh in my face? I am a craft beer girl, and just can't get into whiskey, so are there things (inaccuracies, colors, etc) I should look for in a bottle to see if it's a knockoff or no good?

Ratman_84,3ac8ol,3,whiskey,Best Cheap Sipping Whiskey,"I'm sure this question has been asked before, but things change and new whiskeys hit shelves all the time.

I'm looking for a cheap, but good sipping whiskey. Let me paint a picture of my tastes and budget. My favorite sipping whiskey right now is Laphroaig 10 Year Single Malt Scotch. It's got a peaty/smoky flavor to it that most of my friends don't like, but I love. Almost like smoked salmon. Best deal I can get on it is $40 a bottle. But I can sip whiskey all day so a bottle doesn't last that long. I want some kind of cheaper alternative that is of the same quality, but not necessarily the same taste. I'm open to new tastes. Just something that goes down smooth and I can actually enjoy sipping on. But bonus points if it has that peaty/smoky taste I love.

My go-to alternative right now is your basic Jameson. It's fine. I can sip on it and enjoy it, but I'd like more options. And cheaper if at all possible. Bottle of Jamo now is usually around $30. I'm aware there's a limit to how cheap you can go before the quality of the whiskey drops, but there's gotta be some other whiskeys out there that are on the same quality level as Jameson but cheaper.

My main sources for whiskey are Bevmo, Total Wine, Trader Joe's, Safeway, Raleys, and Rite-Aid. Thanks for the suggestions.",15,2015-06-19 06:44:12

I poured a small glass of it, and let it sit for about 30 minutes. When I came back to it to try it, I stuck my nose deep in the glass like I always do. The nose was instantly very metallic and off-putting. I tried a sip anyway, and I was just hit with a tangy/sour fruity taste along with that metallic taste that I had smelled.

Is this normal for Jameson? It was undrinkable for me, and I don't know if I just got a really bad bottle or if this is what normal Jameson is supposed to be like.

They come up with an awesome rating on amazing, #1 best seller etc, and seem like a neat way to prevent your hand from affecting the drink temperature.

What do you guys think about these? Are they good whiskey drinking glasses?

I didn't want to spend a ton of money, but I didn't want my first Irish Whiskey to be a turn off by being cheap. 

Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm hopeful and excited about possibly getting into something new. For conversation' sake let me ask you this: do you remember your first?",50,2015-04-05 09:16:02

So Bird Dog is cheap, $17 / 750ml at my local liquor store, Jack is $22. I assumed it would be terrible, but thought I could at least get some fake Internet points, so worth it. My usual yardstick lately is Bullet @ $35. 

Well, it's crap, but far better then Jack. It isn't drinkable neat, but 3-finger &amp; an ice cube is fine. Far smoother the Jack. Actually, it's ridiculously smooth with a little ice. 

Also good with Mexican 7-up.

I know good whiskey when I taste it. But what I don't know is what is necessary for a good whiskey. Surely the quality of the grain matters‚Ä¶but what qualities make a good grain? I've heard many Scotch advertisements say they search for the best wood‚Ä¶what makes for good wood? I've had several 12-year whiskeys but still noticed quite a difference in quality. So it's not simply time‚Ä¶there's something more that is impacting quality. But what is it?

Flavorwise, to my palate, the Maker's Mark seems to have a more robust assortment of noticeable flavors. I can't define them individually, but it seems very well-rounded if that makes sense. My experience with the Irish Redbreast agrees with what I've read about Irish whiskeys being more subtle. It teases with flavors but finishes with a noticeable cedar taste. 

What are the contributing factors that make them taste so different but so similar at the same time? I know that is a complicated question, but I got time to read if you have time to enlighten.

MrDoctorProfessorPat,32aayq,7,whiskey,Whiskey Suggestions for a College Kid,"I've somewhat recently been introduced into the world of Whiskey. I've tried some of cheaper brands (Kesslers, Canadian Mist, Mount Royale, ect.) throughout most of my years due to my parents having them as mixers. However, being a college kid, I've started to realize that there are MUCH better whiskey out there and that a good sipping whiskey kicks any mixed drink's ass any day (in my opinion).

I have tried a variety of different types of whiskey and styles. Bourbons, Scotchs, Blended, I've had a taste of just about any of them. At this point, I'm familiar with what I like and what to kind of avoid. I'm looking for some suggestions that you people would suggest! I aim for about a 40$ to 60$ price range. I will say now that I don't care for Scotch to much and I am a big fan of Irish Whiskey.

I would however be willing to try some more Scotch since my experience with it is pretty limited.

Here is a list of Whiskey that I have had/can remember:
Jameson,
Jameson Black Barrel,
Jameson 12 Year Old Reserve,
Booker's Bourbon,
Evan Williams,
JW Black and Red Label,
JW Double Black Label,
Kesslers,

Here's a quick video of their story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vNGBwbgce8

The tour started with a cocktail of your choice.  Ran through milling, mashing, fermenting, distilling, and aging then finished with sampling all of their main products neat.  The table had water with eye droppers as well as ice if you wanted to try them with ice and/or water.

The product is sooooooo young.  They use very small casks (10 gallons) to try to speed up the flavoring of the whiskey, and they also sell a lot of unaged whiskey (no color to it) just like you may have bought back during the early years of our country.  While I appreciated the ""farm to bottle"" sort of aspect of their process, the whiskey itself was very rough.  I look forward to some of their aged offerings in the future.

One other thing that they make, which I thought was their best stuff is a spiced honey spirit.  Almost like rum, but rather than sugar cane or molasses, they use some local honey and add spices in the aging process.  It was delicious.

Anyways, if you're in the Pittsburgh area or just passing through, it's definitely worth the stop to get a tour of the facility.  Was a lot of fun and very informative.  I'd love to read a book on the whiskey rebellion if anyone has a recommendation.",1,2015-04-14 02:02:42

Their venture, Pappy &amp; Company, has just debuted a limited edition Pappy Van Winkle Signature Gift Set pricing for $825 that will likely sell out very quickly.

Limited to 250 in production volume, this special release is not Van Winkle bourbon, but rather high quality accessories (think very high end humidor) that might go alongside that special bottle of whiskey you‚Äôve been waiting to open. Handcrafted by an outfit known as Heritage Handcrafted from reclaimed Pappy Van Winkle bourbon barrel wood, these unique boxes are adorned with a Van Winkle bronze logo and ‚Äútouches of handcrafted iron.‚Äù

What is with these boxes you might wonder? One gets a crystal decanter and two special crystal glasses hand-blown from Scotland, an authentication letter from one of the Van Winkles and a special  ‚Äúcigar (humidor) insert lined with ¬º Spanish cedar‚Äù housing four Pappy cigars made by a cigar company from Nicaragua.

The sets, which are made in lots of 25 until they are all gone, ship a couple of weeks after the order. Sadly, no Van Winkle bourbon is included, but if you have the money to drop on one of these, you likely have a few bottles of this elusive whiskey stashed anyhow.",1,2015-03-11 23:48:34

Have any ideas/tips for people like me?,"In Georgia, when someone buys you a shot they will usually either buy a shot of tequila or a shot of a whiskey. But with a shot of whiskey I immediately gag (which doesn't happen with other liquor). I don't know what it is or why. I don't need to like whiskey, I just want to be able to drink it without gagging. 

I'm guessing starting with a few cocktails would be the best way to get used to the flavor. I've tried a few popular ones like whiskey and Coke and manhattans, but those make me gag too. 

To give an idea of my tastes, I like dark beers like stouts, I'm not a fan of things like IPAs because I find them too hoppy and bitter. My liquor of choice is usually vodka. I am a huge fan of Gin and Tonics. And I know it is looked down on here, but I have no problems drinking Fireball.

murrayhenson,2zwbis,23,whiskey,Finally got to try Yamazaki 12 last night,"I don't often drink whiskey on its own.  Occasionally Scotch on the rocks and still less often, Scotch with some water.  However, last night my go-to cocktail place had some Yamazaki 12 on show so I ordered a double on the rocks.  I should note that between when I started and when I finished the four smallish ice cubes (like the size of big dice) completely melted so I was able to experience this cold, cold with some water, and with perhaps 30% water at room temperature.

Because I don't drink a lot of Scotch on its own I don't have a lot to compare it to and I certainly don't pretend to be Jim Murray's prot√©g√© so this isn't a proper review.  Thus, my feedback consists of the following:  I thought it was very drinkable.  Complex, of course, but no negatives (intense burn, weird aftertastes, etc).  I've seen other reviews that mention ""tropical fruits"" and I didn't get anything like that; it's just really, really smooth.  There is some smoke, some peat, some general spiciness.  It's very enjoyable and I'd definitely have some again.

I live in Poland and Japanese whiskey is very hard to find so it will likely be awhile before I am able to acquire a bottle for myself but if I get the chance, I will.",13,2015-03-22 20:12:04

TheWonder123,2zxqk4,34,whiskey,World Best Pot Still Redbreast 15 - A review,"So with the announcement of Whisky Magazine‚Äôs World Whiskey Awards I thought I would put up my review of the World‚Äôs best pot still Redbreast 15 year old.

I am a huge pot still fan and I am absolutely delighted that Redbreast 15 took the crown at this year‚Äôs awards!

Colour: Golden yellow with a slight hint of red.

Nose: Warm, spice fruit cake, caramel, toffee saltiness, assortment of fruit and honey sweetness.

Palate: large open, full bodied, strong spice, honey sweetness, salty &amp; oily body and slight hints of toasted oak.

Finish: Long finish. Saltiness remained, beautiful toasted oak.

Score: 95/100. (High score and certainly worth it)

Definitely a step up from it‚Äôs younger brother, to be honest I wouldn‚Äôt have even said they were related if I hadn‚Äôt seen the packaging. That said I haven‚Äôt tried the 12 CS strength yet, which I hear gives this expression a run for its money. All in all, this is by far my favourite pot still whiskey out there and I haven‚Äôt a doubt in my mind why it won best pot still. It was originally released as a once off edition but was made a full time expression in IDL‚Äôs brilliant pot still range. I personally am appreciative of the special hand selections that the small run 12 CS, 15 and 21 get to ensure that they are the best the current casks have to offer.

I would put this in the top two best whiskeys I‚Äôve tasted to this point in my existence, maybe that‚Äôll change some day but for now I‚Äôm ensuring I‚Äôm never left without a bottle of 15.

TL;DR: Redbreast 15 is dram good!",6,2015-03-23 04:23:21

I find myself lacking the ability to appropriately identify certain tastes in a whiskey purely because I don't understand what some of them mean. For example: I understand ""peatyness"" is a generally blanketed term that can describe a lot of different whiskey tastes, but I hear it thrown around a lot and I have no idea which taste it's referencing.  

I've google searched guides on how to understand reviews and certain terminology, but I really can't find a stand out guide that I fully understand. Do any of you have a recommended site/book/youtube video that you would recommend to really dive into the method of tasting a whiskey and describing/explaining it's flavors, or even what each flavor is and how to look for it?

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

Full of rich burnt coffee toffee flavour with an aftertaste that went on for miles and miles. The only problem is that this particular bourbon is unavailable in our country (the restaurant is importing) and it just seems silly to pay twice the price to import it myself.

UnoriginalMike,2vdth7,2,whiskey,Bourbon Trail trip recap (reposted here for visibility),"Warning: I am as much a foodie as a whisky fan, so this post will cover both.

We landed in Nashville without too much hullabaloo and headed north.  We had intended to eat in Nashville, but the crowd and the sheer volume of flashing blue lights made us want to get out of town.  So we headed out and ate at a small place for locals, tourist/hipster image [here](http://imgur.com/DgoBTQL)  We were rather a site and got many confused looks, so we finished and left. 

We arrived at a seedy motel in Elizabethtown and stayed the night.  Mind you, we left on Pacific Time and switched to Eastern Time, so when we got up at 6 it felt like 3.  It was a tired morning.  My partner in crime, not pictured, had lived in Virginia for years and had never been to a Waffle House.  Astounded, I insisted we break our fast there.  

On to the good stuff.  We drove out to Bardstown towards Makers Mark.  I recommend the drive, endless farmland.  Though it was quite frozen when we drove past.  We arrived at Makers Mark and they made quite a big deal out of the ambassador program.  If you are not an ambassador, I strongly recommend it, even if Makers isn't a favorite.  Pics with description [here](http://imgur.com/a/WrEbx)

From there we headed for Willet, tired, exhausted, and determined.  We opted to eat after Willet for reasons of time.  Pics [here](http://imgur.com/a/QvjKl)

Finally, Heaven Hill.  Heaven Hill was cool as we finally got some food.  When we walked in we were tired and they offered us a free upgrade to their top tour to make us, and the guide, not need to walk around in the frigid outdoors.  Worth it.  The tour was pretty short, but the bourbon was tasty.  Pics [here](http://imgur.com/a/8kZju)

The Whisky fun is over.  The rest is eats and sights.  Pics [here](http://imgur.com/a/ngQxm) 

From there we headed to Louisville where we stayed at the Seelbach.  If you have never been, go.  Legend has it that was a Capone haunt when he was still in business.  Another legend states that Fitzgerald was inspired to write The Great Gatsby there.  The hotel also houses one of the top 50 bars in the world (which was closed for renovations when we were there, many a poo poo face was had).  The hotel was built at a time before cars, so most travelers probably weren't going to stray too far from the hotel.  As a result, the Seelbach has multiple bars and restaurants.  There was a wedding and most of it was too busy for the likes of us.  So we went down to the Brown Hotel just down the street for dinner at the English Grill.  Fine dining here.  Wow.  There was a loud, obnoxious group of the Louisville elite crowding up the main dining room.  They were drunk and had drunk volume.  We think they were there for some horse trading.  We detected some foreign accents and vague talk of horses.  Pretty interesting.  From there we had intended a pub crawl, but only had the juice to get to Down One.  I loved the bourbon, they had Pappy Van Winkle, we also learned that the stuff we tried for almost free at Heaven Hill goes for upwards of $50/shot.  Pappy was cool, but I was bourboned out.  So we headed back to the hotel intent to hit up the bar in the basement.  It was closed for a private event when we left, and closed for the night on return.  Oops.  We ended up at the bar of the Oak Room, fine dining at the Seelbach.  According to one guys yelp review, they kept a private poker room for Al Capone there.  With enough reservation you can eat, and probably play poker, there.  The bar had Van Winkle Family Rye.  That was worth writing home about.  By that time I was too drunk to remember taking any pics.

Next morning we had intended to go back to Whisky Row and have lunch, but everything was closed due to some kind of bird.  The Superb Owl or some shit.  Anyway, we ate at a microbrew place that was similar to what we have at home.  

We headed for Nashville intent on seeing a plantation before leaving and ended up on the wrong onramp.  Into Indiana we went.  It was very odd to see the change in advertising.  North of the river every billboard seemed to be for a group intended to help you stop drinking or smoking.  South of the river seemed more normal.

We arrived way too late to see the plantation, but ended up at an amazing BBQ joint and watched the majestic bird thing.  It was a pretty cool place.  The locals were coming in by the truck load to get to go orders to eat at home while watching the Owl thingy.  The staff was there completely decked out in Seahawks gear.  Their families were really the only people occupying the dining room other than us.  The food was amazing.  I don't know of any place that makes BBQ like that out here in California.  I think it has to be in your DNA.

We went home, and were ultimately disappointed.  ""Band wagon post about passing when you should have run.""  Luck shined on us the next morning.  We stumbled into Monell's.  A beautiful mansion turned into a restaurant.  Family style seating, family style food.  I ate like a pig, just like the complete stranger sitting next to me.  I strongly recommend the place.

Next stop was the airport, where luck decided to show us the other side of the coin.  Our flight was originally routed through O'Hare and had been cancelled.  So, we ended up being bounced around, ended up going through Denver, and got home well into Monday.  Going to work Monday morning was painful, and I have been trying to recover all week.  Hence the late post.  

TL;DR:  Pics tell the story pretty well.  It was worth the trip.  My dollar went a lot farther than I thought it would.  I heard no Banjo, save Mumford and Sons, and had some of the best Whisky I ever sipped.  What are you waiting for?  GO!",0,2015-02-10 12:24:59

I liked it so much that the alcohol itself was secondary...so I had the brilliant idea of burning it off to see if i could just drink whiskey juice all day. For what it's worth I'm a full on grown man with a family. 

Anyway I took the last 5% of a bottle of Seagrams VO Canadian whisky (which I like very much), poured it in a saucepan, heated it gently for a few minutes on the stovetop, and lit a match to burn the alcohol off. It burned for minutes! The pan itself was full of flame.

After the flame died down and the whiskey cooled off i poured it in a glass to taste it. There was hardly any flavor at all. It wasn't bad though.

At the moment I've had and enjoyed the likes of Bells, Grants, JD, Famous Grouse... My favourite one had to be Johnnie Walker Double Black, but at ¬£35 a bottle it's pretty expensive. The Famous I bought was ¬£17 which seems to be a decent price for that sized bottle over here. However in a bar it's usually ¬£2 for a shot, which would add up to over ¬£40 for a bottle's worth I think, so that kinda makes me feel like spending around 30 or 40 quid isn't actually that bad.

I live in Oregon but am close to the border of Washington. I found that the Thomas H Handy was $79 and the Oban 14 was $77. I can't really buy both right now so I'm torn. Which would you choose? Why? And are these good/good enough prices?

2 Gingers blended Irish Whiskey.  I give it a 3 out of 10.

We are by no means experts, but we certainly enjoy and appreciate trying different types, styles, and brands.  We are putting this out there to find any like minded individuals interested in starting a social whiskey club.

How We See This Working:

We would like to meet once a month at a convenient location somewhere in Washington DC or Northern Virginia and we all bring a bottle of a style or type of whiskey that is agreed upon by the group. We would all drink as much or as little as we would like while enjoying each other's company and making new friends.  The goal is to try new whiskeys, talk about them, and enjoy a common interest among friends.

irish56_ak,2sbvad,7,whiskey,Recommendations on a new Scotch/Irish to try - current collection in text.,"Currently in the cabinet:

Redbreast 21

Jameson 18

Green Spot

Bushmills 16

Connemara 12

Dalwhinnie 15

Bunnahabbain 12

Aberlour 16

Not present but much appreciated: Glenfiddich 15 Solera, Bruichladdich (a couple different offerings...liked them all).

So, based on what you see, what jumps out as something new I should try. My taste for peaty or smokey flavor has evolved, but I'm still not into the very heavily peated Scotch. The Irish peated Connemara is one of my favorites.

Edit: decided on a bottle of Midleton Barry Crocket Legacy. Hope it taste as good at the case it's presented in.

Long story short, I was born on my grandfather's 60th birthday. When I turned 25 (and him 85), I gave him a 25 year-old bottle of Chivas Regal, his favorite whiskey. 

This year, he's turning 90 and is still going strong. I was planning to get him a 30 year-old bottle of Chivas, but I don't believe they make it. 

So, what's your recommendation for a 30 year-old bottle? My max budget is $300-400, and both single malts and blends are both fine.

Usually I'm pretty easy going out mistakes, however this company, was the worst company I've ever dealt with. I've never written a review about a company before but if this prevents 1 person from purchasing whiskey from these folks. It's worth it. 

1. Terrible customer service: 
-After i ordered online i needed a simple address change. my mistake, i know. i emailed their Info@tastersclub: didnt hear a response for a few days. emailed again for the following 10 days. no response. 
-Started to call the phone number associated with their site. Each day... no answer. 

2. You only get any attention after you get upset (if thats you're kinda customer service, THEY'RE GREAT AT IT!):
-After about 15 calls over 10 days and no response, I decide to leave a blunt and short message explaining my frustrations and requesting any help. Less than 30 seconds later I receive a call from the OWNER OF THE COMPANY, Mr. Mack. (only after I get aggrevated does Mr. Mack want to ""help"")
-He apologizes, interrupts me after asking me why I'm frustrated. I have to explain 2 times why his customer service isn't acceptable, because he doesn't understand for some reason. He says he will guarantee that I will get the shipment information to me right when he gets back to his desk. 5 hours later (the current time), still haven't heard from Mr. Mack. 

I hope this gets my point across, might be the cheapest whiskey club, however you get what you pay for. Next time I'll go with another company. Thanks Mister Mack, good work and I hope this brings you all the customers you dreamed of!

MCMixing,2p0m6c,2,whiskey,Crown Royal 75th Anniversary Monarch Blend- a casual review,"Warning- lengthy intro. So I got really into whiskey this year. I've always loved Jameson and Seagrams, but after tasting a neat shot of Crown Royal much earlier this year, I started reading up on different kinds of whiskys and tasting everything I could get my hands on, determined to find anything that could match the smoothness of CR. I've mainly stayed with Canadian blendeds and American bourbons, so my palette hasn't had much scotch but I think I have a fairly sharp sense of taste. I have a buddy who's from Kentucky but also places CR above all else and is my go-to whiskey co-drinker, so sometime last month I snatched up a bargain CR bottle with my first pair of whiskey glasses, commemorating their 75th year and my first. I then discovered that they had a whole anniversary blend and decided that I had to try it out of my nifty new glasses. My buddy and I had just tried the CR Black blend and were very impressed that it could maintain its signature smoothness with a higher proof and bold bourbon flavor and I had just got a new job so fuck it, expensive bottle ho!



[It's a beautiful package.](http://imgur.com/BgFejVK) I'm already satisfied with my purchase just for the neat box, unique bag and awesome crown top. We reveled in all that for a minute before unscrewing the enormous top and taking a nose. We could immediately tell that it has more of a kick than the regular blend, it has a spicier and stronger aroma. We pour it out and take a sip neat before cutting in some cold Coke. It's a pretty aggressive taste, not at all what I was expecting. Smooth on the front, opening up big time in the mid palette for an unusually strong spiced flavor, and finishing almost with the burn of a bourbon. Huh. In Coke, you could probably convince me it was Makers Mark. It's good and I enjoy the flavor quite a bit, but I'm a little surprised that it's not nearly as smooth as other CR blends. Strange how it tastes more aged than a regular bottle- but since it doesn't state its length anywhere, we can only assume that it spent the minimum 3 years for Canadian whiskey.

But it seems like a boring gift since its basically the same thing every year. I mix it up with different brands but to me (a non-whiskey drinker who things they all taste the same) it seems like just another bottle.

HobbitGirl91,2p7k7u,4,whiskey,Help! Looking for Something Like Celtic Honey,"Earlier this year, I discovered Celtic Honey whiskey and found that it is definitely MY drink. The problem: one shop in town carried it, and as of this month they have stopped carrying it. According to their website, there are a few other shops in the state that carry it, but they're a few hours away...

So, could anyone direct me towards a honey whiskey that is similar in flavor to Celtic Honey? Something that I really liked about the Celtic Honey was that it was quite sweet, and the whiskey flavor wasn't overpowering... I tried Jack Daniel's honey whiskey, but it just tasted like plain whiskey to me (though, to be fair here, I'm not a very experienced whiskey drinker). Any help would be appreciated! I know there are a lot of honey whiskeys out there, but I'd rather not waste a lot of money on whiskeys that I don't end up liking.",11,2014-12-14 06:40:18

I feel we have enough tag-along members to start a new club. My question stems from the idea of changing venues. My own apartment and that of a few others are available however I am wondering if there might be some other options.

We can bring wine into a restaurant in my city (legally or technically, it the owner allows it) however I doubt the same goes for a bottle of sweet nectar. 

In the summer we could technically go on a hike anywhere as long as we avoid getting pinched for open liquor (probably not going to get caught in the big old rain-forest). So like camping trips, cabins and such are another idea.

Basically when they traveled on planes or went to different countries, they would try and find some sort of alcohol in the miniature bottles and bring them back home and collect them. They sat in the kitchen and over time they would get gross from the smoke and grime from cooking and they would have to clean them every now and then. You will see some have been cracked open from mishandling them. But sometime in the 90s they finally made a custom display where they sat undisturbed. 
 
I am 28 and recently decided to get into whiskey and try it out as a hobby, finding out what I like, dislike, and educating myself. I've been lurking here for awhile, learning and I appreciate all of your help! However, I decided to ask my step-mom if she would will this down to me and she said she would. (Sounds a bit terrible I know, but she's getting old and knows it. She's realistic.)

So, are any of these worth drinking or even safe to drink? Are there some worth selling over drinking? I think that Crown Royal has a date on it of 1965, at least there was a 1965 sticker on the top. Please excuse my ignorance. What more information can I provide to help? I can do a catalog of what is in there to help out, I just took a few quick photos to see if it's even worth the time.

The case itself has around 100-200 bottles of various alcohols including tequila, rum, vodka, grain alcohol, wines, brandy, and whatnot.

I know he enjoys Whistle Pig Rye for sure... I've also seen him drink Elijah Craig, Jameson...I don't know the exact kind/year though...

ANYWAYS. My price range is anywhere from $100~$150, although if it's like $10 or $20 more expensive that's fine too. And also, as I mentioned, he does drink and enjoy whiskey quite often so it doesn't have to be a whiskey that would be good for beginners or anything.

Thanks in advance for any input...I am so lost in this whiskey world. :'(

Edit: I would also like some opinions... I've been using Google and I think maybe the Glenmorangie 18 Year sounds good? Is that okay? Or is the Bowmore better? Agh!!! So many options :-(....",21,2014-11-10 17:12:10

I started drinking when I turned 21 (USA), and got into whiskey pretty quickly. Bourbon, mostly (my favorites being Woodford Reserve, 1792 Ridgemont Reserve, Four Roses). I tried some scotch blends (J&amp;B, JW Red, Dewar's) and wasn't impressed.  Last year, I tasted The Balvenie 12 DoubleWood, and it opened my eyes to everything scotch could be. 

When I got married in August, friends gifted me The Balvenie 15yo Sherry Cask, and that kicked off my whiskey collection. I now have that Balvenie, Glendronach 12, Monkey Shoulder, Bastille 1789, and some Jameson. 

I've got my next bottle selection down to two choices: The Balvenie Doublewood (where it all started for me), or Blanton's. Never tried the Blanton's, but I've heard good things.

Now, I'm in Ontario so my options of finding this seem pretty darn limited since I only have the LCBO to rely on, so I'm hoping to get some recommendations for alternative brands. Ideally I'd like to get him a really nice bottle for Christmas but I have no idea what i'm doing since I'm not yet a whiskey girl! 

He seemed interested in the XO because he's heard it was very smooth, and he's had other types that are a bit harsh or are unpleasant on the way down. He's mainly been sticking to Canadian whiskeys in a conscious effort to experience what Canada has to offer, but I'd personally be willing to get him something from outside our country if the quality is there.

These are basic qualities that I've gleaned from his tastes over time: smooth, spiced (optional), balanced, a bit on the dry side.
Currently sitting in our cabinet we have: Stalk and Barrel 1+11 Special Blend, White Owl Whiskey, Canadian Club Classic 12, and Spicebox Genuine Spiced Whiskey 70 proof.

If possible, I'd like to keep it $100 or under.

Again, I'm just stuck with what the LCBO has to offer so if anyone has some information or first hand experience with some of the brands they offer, it would be a huge help. Thanks in advance!

Edit: You guys are all amazing! Thanks a million for all the great suggestions. I feel pretty confident I'll be able to get my guy something really good! xoxo",23,2014-11-27 02:29:50

I'll post a picture when these arrive - should be Saturday/Monday as I got 2 day air shipping.

Hawkeye1113,2jys3r,6,whiskey,"A question that gets asked here a lot, I'm sure, with a twist.","So, whiskey noob here. 

I've had brief experiences with whiskey in college (which comes into play later). Mostly cheaper bourbons, canadians, and (of course) Jameson. I recently got some whiskey stones and that got me thinking about trying to find a whiskey I'd like. Problem is I have little idea of where to look or what to look at/for.

Now, here's where the twist comes in. Remember that thing about college? Well, I had a bad experience with some Jack Daniels one night that formed a fairly strong aversion to the smell and taste of many whiskeys (especially bourbon). Long story short, it was a ""I ended up damaging/throwing up my stomach lining"" bad kind of experience, if that gives you a clue on how strong this aversion is. It's been probably 5 or 6 years now, but it's still there.

So, I need some advice on what to try. I'm looking for something a little more special than bottom/mid shelf, but nothing that will cost me more than $70-80. Something I can sip when I come home from a long day at work or while enjoying a book. Preferably smooth, flavorful but not overpowering. My limited knowledge from reading about whiskey briefly and working in alcohol sales (as well as a bar) tells me I should be looking for a scotch whiskey, but I'm probably wrong.

So, given that information, does anyone have any advice on where to start?",18,2014-10-22 12:57:31

I had another drop of it a couple of days later and it was a completely different experience.

What initially intrigued me was that I discovered Jim Beam has one called Kentucky Fire and it sounded pretty good. I've never heard anything on whether it's good or not.

I was looking into it because I saw that Jim Beam has a maple line out and maple whisky just sounds amazing to me. I was at Rite-Aid yesterday and saw that Crown Royal has a maple whisky too and I figure that since its Canadian and they're known for maple syrup and regular Crown Royal is already awesome, the maple has to be even better.

My dilemma is that I don't know where to start. I'm sure that some of you have tried these and can help me out with suggestions on the subject. I'm also open to other suggestions retaining to maple and cinnamon.",37,2014-11-02 11:58:20

gkleinman,2g1c8u,6,whiskey,2014 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection Whiskeys,"I think we're the first up with reviews on these so I wanted to bring them to the /r/whiskey community:

**George T. Stagg Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**
George T. Stagg is the archetypal power whiskey, and Buffalo Trace has again delivered another expression of George T. Stagg in that style. In many ways it‚Äôs a little bit of a head fake before the knock out punch. The entry is really good and we really like the integration between the strong flavors, but the end of the midpalate and the finish are over oaked. With so many other big oak releases out there, it may be what people are coming to expect, but it could have been handled with a little more finesse. Then again, Stagg is always more power than finesse.  A solid, but imperfect release that will appease Stagg fans, but fall short of winning a ton of awards. **91 points**


**William Larue Weller Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**
The opening and midpalate set the stage for William Larue Weller‚Äôs crescendo, and when it comes, it‚Äôs really spectacular. The finish is, of course, dry, defined greatly in part by the alcohol blast at the end of the midpalate, and accompanied by toffee and sweet charred oak. The William Larue Weller takes water extremely well - a few drops intensifies the lushness of the whiskey.

Good whiskey has the ability to take you on a journey, and this year‚Äôs William Larue Weller does just that. It‚Äôs a more complete whiskey than this year‚Äôs George T. Stagg and ultimately a much better one. **95 points**.


**Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye**
While Thomas H. Handy isn‚Äôt horrid, it‚Äôs not even close to the standard that Buffalo Trace has set for this brand. For us, this will be the benchmark whiskey in this collection for reviews. Read a review that raves about this misfire and you know that the reviewer may be rating the label more than the whiskey in the bottle. **80 points**.


**Eagle Rare 17 Year Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**
This year‚Äôs Eagle Rare release (like many of the other entries in the Eagle Rare line) proves that great whiskey doesn‚Äôt have to be so difficult: capture some nice flavors with balance, integration, a nice mouthfeel, and a good finish, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for success. Eagle Rare continues its line of success with another standout release in this year‚Äôs collection. **93 points**


**Sazerac Rye 18 Year Old Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey**
Sazerac Rye 18 is one of the most balanced and integrated whiskeys in this year‚Äôs collection. It‚Äôs not as stand-out spectacular as the William Larue Weller, but it‚Äôs much better than this year‚Äôs Thomas H. Handy, and ultimately it is very well-crafted whiskey. **92 points**

I am pretty new to whiskey in general, but I am enjoying what I have explored so far.  I live in montana, and we are getting more and more local distillers to experience.  

Recently, I have begun to explore Single Malt Scotch, and I am really enjoying it.  I was curious what people's favorites in this realm are.  So far I have tried Ackentoshan, Laphroaig, Old Pulteney, Dalmore, Glenmorangie, and Redbreast.  I am looking for good next steps.  I do enjoy peetiness, but I am also looking for new flavors to sample.

Any advice?  I know there are other similiar questions from months ago, but since tastes change, it cannot hurt to revisit.

So I have possibly a weird one. I got a bottle of Bulleit Rye last Thursday. I had some on both Friday night and Saturday night while camping and then shelved it for the week. When I opened it up for a glass last night, its profile was completely changed. Most notably it had lost its spice, bite, and developed a sweetness I didn't expect. There was no large temperature change, but it may have been jostled around in the car. Now it is a given that any whisky will change change flavor after oxidizing or bruising, but I have never had anything happen as quickly as a week. Is it possible that I bruised the hell out of it while camping and this is what caused the flavor change so quickly? My first thought was that I got a bad quark, but that should have muddled the flavor before opening. Any other ideas?",4,2014-09-21 06:22:07

[deleted],2dny4a,10,whiskey,Laphroaig - a noob's review,"http://imgur.com/1wLFgHF

Bought myself a bottle of 10 year Laphroaig for the first time. I've been meaning to try it for quite a while but I've always gone with something else instead, perhaps because it gets quite mixed reviews.

Thought I'd document my first thoughts here.

**Quick smell:** The first thing that came to mind was damp earth. Reminded me of playing in the garden as a child and pulling up a large stone or rock that hadn't been moved for a long time. That rising aroma of wet soil as a woodlouse scurries past a wriggling worm.
Definitely some saltiness there too, mixed with a whiff of damp vegetation which gives me a hint of seaweed. But it's definitely a wet and rainy day on this beach.
There's a bit of orange there, with a touch of spice. Similar to the mince pies my nan used to make at Christmas.
I found it an extremely pleasant smell, and very distinctive. I'm pretty sure that after this single smelling I'd be able to identify Laphroaig any time.

**Taste:** A lot of saltiness on the tongue, an almost bitter woodiness. There's a softer side to it as well, I struggled for a while to explain it, but I think its kind of creamy. As I was tasting it, a bit of it went down the wrong way, and I found myself coughing, at which point a nice taste of vanilla essence came through.

**After taste:** This goes on for a long time. I could sit here for an hour and still taste it in my mouth. There's some orange peel, creamy boiled sweets. Again there's the saltiness, which actually becomes stronger as I move my tongue along the roof of my mouth. Some of the flavours taste like things that I probably shouldn't be drinking, but can't quite put my finger on. As I exhale there's some liquorice there, and as I inhale there's that creaminess again. 

**Verdict:** This may be the first whiskey that I buy twice in a row (I always buy something I've never tried before). Really enjoyed it. It's strange because I can almost taste exactly what the bad reviews are talking about, but I personally can't identify any of them as negative points. Very refreshing. I probably find the smell the most pleasurable part (only slightly ahead of the taste though). It really feels like you're taking in a massive breath of ocean air.

I won't attempt to give it a score, because I don't feel qualified. But if there are any of you that haven't given it a try, I'd strongly recommend it.

I'll look into other Islay whiskey's to try next.

I've been drinking this stuff for a few years, so I'm very familiar with the taste.  This bottle seems bad - smells like pure alcohol or ethanol, not much whiskey flavor at all.  I've had a few drinks with it and not gotten sick or anything, it just tastes bad and lacking whiskey flavor.

So, did this spoil or go bad?  Just a bad batch?  Not aged properly?

I've searched the internets and can't find any info on bad whiskey.  No one thinks whiskeys will ever go bad or spoil, so I'm wondering what happened to this bottle?  I've had a similar experience with a bottle of Black Velvet before, too.  I realize these aren't the finest whiskeys, but I would think they would be consistent, considering the quantities produced.

Anyone have any experience like this or knowledge about what happened?",6,2014-08-24 23:49:06

TheSubGenius,2esns7,23,whiskey,I got lucky and managed to get a bottle of this stuff for $50. My first big whiskey purchase: Laphroaig cask strength #5,"I've always enjoyed whiskey, but I've haven't had a taste for the ones from Islay, the worst whiskey I've ever had was a cheap Islay that tasted like burnt electronics.  The Laphroaig, however is delicious so I'll leave you with some of my notes.

Neat:

Very intense odor of the ocean, salty with the funkiness of old wet seaweed sitting on the beach.  When you get your nose close, the burn reminds me of getting seawater up my nose when I was a kid, only this time near an iodine spill.  

The taste comes with a lot of smoke and spice up front, with a large oak aroma.  The smoky peat lingers,  but I was having trouble picking many flavors out because at 57.2% abv my tongue numbed out very quickly trying to swish it around.

With water:

On the nose it opened up quite a bit with a bit of water.  Light, sweet malt started to appear, and to oak came forward with some vanilla and fruit notes. 

Tasting it, the briny sea flavors were still there but had much better balance when the malt was not being overpowered by the alcohol.  A great whiskey to chew on for a while and examine it has a thick, pleasant mouthfeel when diluted.

Overall, I'll say 90/100 points, worth it if you can afford it or find it.

AntiSocialMoron,2ae4jb,19,whiskey,I'm heading to the liquor store tomorrow and looking for suggestions/pointers.,"Let me start by saying I'm new here and just looked up this sub a few minutes ago. I'm fairly new to whiskey, but have really discovered an affinity to it over the last few months. I'm mainly looking for a point in the right direction and a small education that i can expand upon in the future.

I don't really know a whole lot (couldn't even explain the pros/cons of single malts, double barrels, etc.) However I've found the best bottles I've bought this far have been single malt scotchs and I feel any step in that direction would be most favorable.

As an example to what I've tasted so far, over the last few months I've purchased a Dewar 12 year double barrel, 12 year Hakushu, 12 year Hibiki, Blanton's and a 14 year Oban (these being the ones worth mentioning/that I've actually enjoyed) What's the best next purchase for me? Should I expand out, or any suggestions of similar bottle I might enjoy that isn't totally impractical price wise? Any pointers would be much appreciated 

P.S. I'm not a big fan of bourbons. Unless it's truly a wonderful drink I'd prefer to stay away from that. Also, I hate to drink anything on the rocks and prefer a straight pour with room temp water to clean the palate. Don't know if that would affect anyone's suggestions,  but it's my preference as to how I drink. Thanks in advance",14,2014-07-11 10:43:07

I have been collecting and drinking for a month or so now. Where I live, it's hard to find most of the brands and their specific editions, so I tell anybody who goes abroad to buy me something. For now I have the following whiskies at hand:

&gt;*Dalmore Valour, Glenfiddich 15YO, Glenlivet Master Distillers Reserve, Macallan 12YO Sherry Oak, Lagavulin 1995 Distillers Edition, Talisker 10YO, Tullamore Dew 12YO Sherry Cask Finish*

Which kinds of whiskies should I go for in general. Also to be more specific
I have a friend who will go to Europe. He will buy 2 bottles for me, I have a few hours to give him a list. So any quick advice is welcome. I try to not go above 60 Euros per bottle, since I am only a beginner. Here are the options:

- Balvenie Triple Cask 12YO (almost certainly will buy it since I read too many good reviews and I am really interested)
- Glen Grant 10YO
- Woodford Reserve (hard to find in European airports, so leaning towards it while I have the chance)
- Bunnahabhain Darach Ur
- Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 
- Bowmore Black Rock
- Isle of Jura Turas Mara
- Glenfiddich Reserve Cask

What do you think? You may notice most are travel exclusives since he will buy from a duty free. 

Also I have a friend who will go to NY and I can get any bottle of my choice from from DrinkUpNY:

Ib_dI,2cesm3,34,whiskey,Suddenly whiskey is really easy to drink and very sweet sometimes. Have I levelled up in whiskey-drinking?,"I used to find it quite hard to drink whiskey and always needed a mixer of some variety but in the last few months I've been making a point of just sipping it neat or with some water.

I've gone through a variety of whiskeys like this with a large range of flavours. Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban, Glenfiddich single malt 12 year, Craigellachie Cask Strength 8 year (106 proof / 60.3%), Bushmills 10 year single malt, Bog-standard Bushmills, Laphroaig, Famous Grouse (don't judge me - it was cheap) and even a half bottle of Suntory too. 

It's been a mad, tasty roller-coaster adventure! The Craigellachie was a demon. It was like taking on a minotaur at first but then it turned out to be a bear hug from a best mate instead. The 10 year Bushmills was like liquid sex...

But - while I got lots of really varied and yummy flavours out of all of the above -  they were still kinda hard going and I had to add water to really enjoy them (which I'm totally ok with - it helps get the flavours out).

Suddenly whiskey is really sweet and it's WAY too easy to drink. What the hell's going on? Have I reached some kind of tolerance level or palette-upgrade? Is this normal? What can I expect to happen next?",30,2014-08-02 16:22:42

This week everything changed suddenly.  We have a new rep with the distributer who provides buffalo trace products and the first day he came to the bar he brought us 5 bottles of Elmer T. Lee (the regular not the commemorative).  We were all so pumped!  Then the next day I went to a shop to buy wine and there were to bottles on the shelf.  For the last year you had to twist a managers arm to buy a bottle out of the back but there it was on the shelf. 

So my question is: is Elmer T. Lee somewhat commonly available or did I just get lucky and maybe my new rep is just the man?",5,2014-08-04 01:31:08

[deleted],28kntm,0,whiskey,Is ice good for whiskey?,"Depending on who you talk to, some people say its a sin to add anything to a good whiskey. I for one disagree as a little bit of water and a lower temperature bring out the flavors to be released in your mouth instead of the glass. Of course too much ice dilutes the drink and spoils it. 
The solution I have found is to use an ice sphere press as it creates ice with the following 
The size and shape of the ice you use play a key role in how drinks taste. 

A cube of ice will melt faster than an ice orb (sphere or ball)  because of the orb‚Äôs shape due that it has less surface area.

A drink made with small cubes will taste best when it‚Äôs first served, but becomes watery and less flavorful in short order. 

Larger ice balls melt slower and release less water into a drink.  Meaning the first sip will taste as good as the last.

An ice orb (ball) will last 4-6 times as long as ice cubes leaving you plenty of time to enjoy your drink.

kyrj92,26juu5,9,whiskey,New to Rye. Looking for recommendations.,"Based on the recommendation of a friend I've developed an interest for Rye Whiskey. I've grown up in Kentucky and currently go to the University of Kentucky so pretty much all of my friends and family are into bourbon. I've been of legal drinking age for about a year now so I've really been developing a taste for different kinds of bourbon. However, I just had a bottle of Bulleit Rye and I love it. Where should I go from here? I've thought about Knob Creek Rye because their bourbon is one of my favorites.",10,2014-05-27 05:13:14

WhiskeyTimes,22omam,9,whiskey,A Journey Across The World for Great Whiskey,"An experience of www.whiskeytimes.com

In October of 2013 I journeyed across the globe from my humble surroundings of the midwest to the far away land of exotic Singapore to engulf myself with some of the best and most famous whiskies of the world and take part in the culture and meet the people that love and produce it.

To be surrounded by such great whiskies and by people who enjoy and appreciate the pleasure, culture and history of this great spirit was an absolute dream come true for any whisky lover.

Whisky Live Singapore 2013 was the event, the Raffles Hotel was the place. An intimate tasting among connoisseurs, novices and anyone with an adventurous spirit and a curious thirst of wanderlust and whisky. I would not have wanted to be anywhere else in the world on that day. It was an amazing and profoundly fascinating time meeting and talking to all of the exhibitors and to all of the friendly patrons gathered at this event set in this historic colonial hotel. An experience I will not soon forget. It only deepened my love for whisky and the different complexities and truly unique personalities each whisky brings.

As I looked around the famous Bar and Billiard Room at the Raffles Hotel and saw all of these whisky enthusiasts in one place it brought a wonderful sense of community, tradition and a recognized understanding of the true love for this whisky craft and culture we all love and share. This was a setting for a great time.

The Raffles Hotel is regarded as one of the most prestigious hotels in the world. Whisky Live Singapore brought in many different exhibitors and people from all over the world and from all walks of life. Many known whiskies represented there and a few new and innovative whiskies to be tried from first time distilleries. Some aspiring countries trying their hand at crafting whisky for the first time and making their own mark in the world. It was all so delicious and fascinating. Every exhibitor had a different story to tell.

I bring back to the U.S. so many wonderful memories of great smokey peat flavors and sweet caramel aromas that still perfumes my mind to this day. But I also brought back photos of my time at Whisky Live for all to see. Whisky Live - The World's Premier Whisky Tasting Show. This is an international event all whisky lovers need to attend.

Please enjoy October 19th, Whisky Live Singapore 2013.

Thanks in advance!

I work at a pub with a whole pile of Irish whiskeys (~50) and I've been trying to learn more about them so I can talk intelligently about them to customers.  I bought one of those little ""33 drams of whiskey"" books, and I'm enjoying using it, but the little wheel they provide uses some words I've never heard of in terms of whiskey (e.g. tannic and char) and other words where I know what they're talking about, but not how to pick out the flavors (e.g. floral). 

So I guess the question I'm getting at here is how do I train my palate to recognize and pick out different flavors in a whiskey?

[deleted],24qewm,1,whiskey,Getting a present from the USA. Which bourbon or rye should I go for?,"I don't know whether I prefer bourbon or rye - at a push I'd say rye, but I couldn't give you a reason - so my question is, which should I go for out? I've already done Rittenhouse, loved it but I'd like to try some others - perhaps Bulleit, Wild Turkey, Knob Creek, Buffalo Trace? They're all available in the UK online but the markup is quite ridiculous.",0,2014-05-05 08:06:02

calschmidt,24rov1,11,whiskey,Something to make you laugh or cry,My grandmother had a bottle of 1973 Campbeltown whiskey (mull of kintyre) in her cupboard. She wanted to make orange bread and butter pudding which requires a fair amount of whiskey to flavour. She used it. On the plus side I got to drink some 41 year old single malt and I'm certain I will never try any whiskey as good again,6,2014-05-05 20:10:56

Dr_Clobber,250bfh,22,whiskey,"Maybe I'm just a weakling, but I'm having a lot of trouble drinking whiskey.","I'm a lover of craft beer, and have since decided to branch out into liquors. Whiskey is what I'm gravitating to, because I understand how much skill and effort goes into making it. However, I'm having trouble.

I bought Tullamore Dew, which is supposed to be very easy to drink. I put a few rocks into my glass and find myself gagging after large sips, or painfully choking down small ones.

Does it get easier, or am I not cut out for whiskey? I know it's an acquired taste (like beer) but I didn't expect it to be this difficult. Shots aren't hard for me to do, nor are mixed drinks. Any tips are greatly appreciated so I can really start enjoying whiskey.",30,2014-05-08 10:30:07
