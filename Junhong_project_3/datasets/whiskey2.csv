one year ago proper twelve irish whiskey proof one bottles got going business sale last winter figured would try lot irish whiskeys compared american scottish options mma fan seen countless ads low expectations actually exceeded tasted quite good opinion kind standard terms taste smooth enough sweetness hard compare something like years recollection like jameson nearly much try someday brenne

discussion sourced whisk japanese whisky wonderful gent whiskeytribe made fun info graph offered share know japanese whisky took long time write figured share open discussion sourced whiskies wanted paint entire picture go making chart people start relying important note lot things get overly simplified probably much info like learn legit japanese whisky producers individual level feel free ask go sake time whisky rising stefan van eycken way whisky dave broom amazing resources anyone wants learn jp whisky laws first thing note making whisky japan vague concept japan officially making whisky less years trial error honestly nothing similar would define whisky today additionally knew japanese whisky would blow way people making whisky even people found loopholes selling sourced whisky japanese whisky hard draw line making whisky right wrong reasons probably japanese government really done anything whisky associations stepping make change tokyo whisky spirits competition organized want enter must follow requirements mashing grain saccharification without koji see shochu vs whisky paragraph fermentation distillation year aging must take place japan blending bottling take place outside japan interesting real law regarding japanese whisky establishment needs whisky license means house whisky emphasize production aspect even though laws respectable japanese whisky distillers typically follow scotch law aged min years min abv obv made japan current definition japanese whisky put new graph says whisky distilled cereal grains aged wooden barrels believe us definition whisky comes play look aged shochu category aka rice whisky shochu vs whisky real quick eli think shochu distilled sake brewed rice beverage abv similar wine except made grain barley potato rice sugarcane buckwheat ppl also use unique things like tomatoes distilled twice important thing note shochu like sake undergo malting process instead creating sugar via soaking drying germination get mold spore called koji japan shochu aged barrels synonymous whisky law shochus strictly regulated much point aged shochu darker certain color time get barrel aged shochu whisky japan us call whisky cereal grain aged barrels fukano ohishi examples often referred rice whiskies important remember spirit making process majorly different said tasting compare whisky fair spirit need compare anything think distilled sake also noting rice taste corn rye wheat whisk sourcing whisky sourced whisky bad whisky take home message deception never good sourced whisky equate bad whisky definitely always true alas deception sourced whisky sadly usually often times associated remember sourcing whisky around since beginning whisky making history insistent sourced bad immediately assume spew stuff told without research understandable lot liquor brands use marketing tool days scotch irish whiskies long history sourcing sharing whiskies see canada us hell half bourbon market comes midwest even though says kentucky vermont colorado etc label situations like see people jump conclusions sourced whiskies bad feel deceived blame tell texans tito vodka made austin get defensive get sourced whisky bad showcased last sentences deception sucks like lied know said japanese whisky laws put place one thought would become big deal imagine happened brands let say decades ago started sourcing indiana white dog aging warehouse likely afford set distillery well really expensive probably realize people would care much years later emphasis craft products authenticity totally reshaped whiskey market today people care people want authentic products see brands transparent sourcing going away financial standpoint many people source economical option brand decides exceptions everything saying people need realize go saying sourced bad totally generalize cuz everything black white oversimplifying anything makes easier digest understand lot sourcing people trying trick mention local distillery probably use easy lazy sales pitch deter away competition support local saying easy sales pitch encounter time anyway back japan see lots examples sourced whisky bad japan whisky laws source bunch whisky teaspoon whatever japanese distillate wanna extra fancy export japanese whisky make lot money selling scotch canadian whisky japanese whisky way happening japanese whisky world problematic lying people straight taking advantage hype scarcity japanese whisky japan know japanese whisky would get insane hype getting today stems recognitions world whiskies awards japanese whiskies received last decades lot ran stock aged spirit takes time also let say one poor individuals bought one sourced japanese whiskies chances great gives japanese whisky bad name happened think wow japanese whisky really overrated sucked unfair real producers working hard make delicious whiskies buy sourced japanese whisky liked great consumer perspective honestly matters end discussing sourced japanese whiskies people often mention matsui shuzo started physical distillery yet age statement kurayoshi whiskies ranging years age people also like emphasize fact packaging looks lot like suntory whiskies lol anyway age statement whiskies distillery simple sourced elsewhere japanese looking label matsui ended getting ton heat eventually built distillery though releasing stuff matsui whisky calling new whiskies single malts despite less year old law stop respectable distilleries would refer new born whisky anything years old according twsc mentioned earlier respectable distilleries follow scotch laws see new producers like akkeshi kanosuke releasing newer single malts new born whiskies bad sourced whisky heck good sourced whisky obviously subjective eyes good sourced whisky sourced whisky
