My rum journey and request for guidance,Hi all Lurking a while but thought I would finally ask for guidance Thought I would post my rum journey in the hopes that it helps First let me apologize ahead of time lol for the ignorant newbie post I ve hung out at enough specialty niche boards to know these kinds of posts can be annoying If it s any consolation I really do want to learn and really do want to up my rum game So my rum journey started about years ago at age ish Interestingly enough I was at happy hour with an intoxicated boss trying to fend her off from taking me back to her place So I turned the conversation to why she ordered all her drinks with top shelf liquor I myself was drinking Jack n Cokes my go to at the time She said it really made a difference esp the next morning So I ordered my next rum n coke with whatever top shelf rum they had It was Private Stock At the time I didn t know PS was CM s top shelf rum When I took my first sip I pissed myself The difference was night and day After that day I began stocking up on PS at home and trying to learn more about rum online Perusing my local mega grocery store one day I spotted Zaya I was intrigued A blend of rums aged years I tried it and it immediately replaced my PS Zaya continues to be my regular go to rum although it is VERY sweet and I have to cut it usually I have also been purchasing additional rums to try either at home or when out In the last years and in addition to Private Stock and Zaya I ve tried Myer s Original Pyrat XO Reserve Kasama Small Batch Sailor Jerry Spiced The Kraken Black Spiced Pusser s Original Mount Gay Eclipse My current go tos are Zaya for mixed and Pusser s for mixed or straight with a splash of water I will sheepishly admit that I have never tried white rum but am curious what you all thought of it Should I include it in my exploration Most of my exploration has not taken be beyond local grocery stores and a couple specialty stores within a few miles But I am willing to travel a dozen or so miles for a better rum if that is the only location near me selling it Also any good online retails are appreciated I am in the U S So what am I after I would like to find a rum that I can learn to sip neat and unadulterated no mixer no water no ice Pusser s was the only one that came close to me doing that but it was still too harsh for me so I add a splash of water when I don t feel like Coke with it Also I am not a fan of bourbon so would probably not like rums that lean in that direction Suggestions are most welcome D,2,My rum journey and request for

Plantation Jamaica Panama , Plantation Panama was the first real bottle of rum that I bought myself going back some years I recently saw the Panama pop up and with such a beautiful label my interest was piqued The tasting notes looked good so I ve had my eye on it When the Jamaican recently popped up with a similar label and even nicer sounding tasting notes I pulled the trigger and ordered them both The ABVs are slightly higher than a bog standard and so I justified the purchase to myself I realise that Plantation add sugar to their rums but my cabinet is getting a little too serious as of late so fancied something a bit fun probably sweet for those nights when I crave a sugar hit although having just read the blurb neither bottle supposedly has added sugar Plantation Rum Panama is a molasses rum from the Alcoholes Del Istmo distillery The rums that make up this blend are from a selection of barrels The day fermentation was preceded by a column distillation followed by years of ageing in a tropical climate in bourbon barrels The rum was then further matured in France in barrels that had contained Ferrand cognac No dosage was carried out on this year old rum which means that it has no added sugar Plantation Rum Jamaica had a long fermentation of to days this molasses rum was distilled in the Vendôme Double retort still of the legendary Clarendon distillery in Jamaica The rum was aged on site for years in litre bourbon barrels and then more years in France in litre cognac barrels Bottled in with no added sugar this vintage rum has an ester content of grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol I popped both corks earlier for a quick sniff The Panamanian smells like cherry apricot peach and some camphor coming through The Jamaican smells like sweet tropical fruit pineapple Excited to try them both I will report back with my findings D,2,Plantation Jamaica Panama   Plantation Panama was the first real bottle of rum that I bought myself going back some years I recently saw the Panama pop up and with such a beautiful label my interest was piqued The tasting notes looked good so I ve had my eye on it When the Jamaican recently popped up with a similar label and even nicer sounding tasting notes I pulled the trigger and ordered them both The ABVs are slightly higher than a bog standard and so I justified the purchase to myself I realise that Plantation add sugar to their rums but my cabinet is getting a little too serious as of late so fancied something a bit fun probably sweet for those nights when I crave a sugar hit although having just read the blurb neither bottle supposedly has added sugar Plantation Rum Panama is a molasses rum from the Alcoholes Del Istmo distillery The rums that make up this blend are from a selection of barrels The day fermentation was preceded by a column distillation followed by years of ageing in a tropical climate in bourbon barrels The rum was then further matured in France in barrels that had contained Ferrand cognac No dosage was carried out on this year old rum which means that it has no added sugar Plantation Rum Jamaica had a long fermentation of to days this molasses rum was distilled in the Vendôme Double retort still of the legendary Clarendon distillery in Jamaica The rum was aged on site for years in litre bourbon barrels and then more years in France in litre cognac barrels Bottled in with no added sugar this vintage rum has an ester content of grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol I popped both corks earlier for a quick sniff The Panamanian smells like cherry apricot peach and some camphor coming through The Jamaican smells like sweet tropical fruit pineapple Excited to try them both I will report back with my findings D

Identifying and trying to solve supply problems in the Canadian rum market My thoughts and a request for others to share their experience trying to explore Tiki and Rum north of , The Problem In the last years that I ve been getting into rum and Tiki I ve continually ran headfirst into the problem that I suspect most other Canadian users who casually browse here have as well Rum availability both in terms of country of origin and distillery variety quite frankly sucks north of the American border The LCBO are notorious for understocking and price gouging and although less regulation in my home province of Alberta is touted as making it a better market for spirits it mainly manifests itself in whiskey availability out here I cannot speak for every province in the country but I suspect the same problem pops up elsewhere Stores are stocked to the gills with the full lineup of mass market brands such as Lambs Appleton Captain Morgan and Bacardi and the majority of anything outside of those staples usually consist of premium heavily dosed Latin rons such as Zacapa Diplomatico or stuff like Bumbu This leaves a dearth in many of the categories and rums used in mixing and especially in classic Tiki recipes Compounding on this problem is that I find many of the online guides and suggestions tend to assume you have access to American or UK availability which vastly outstrip Canadian offerings Resources such as Smugglers Cove and Minimalist Tiki are tremendously useful here as they break down different country of origin and styles to use and give many different possible substitutions and alternatives within a single style rather than just telling you to buy a Hampden or Hamilton blend within the style However there are still some unavoidable gaps that I d like to specifically address ask for feedback on how best to get around them and offer some of my own crude but thought out solutions The Biggest Gaps in the Market Agricoles In my experience this is by far the least available type of rum in Canada Unaged AOCs simply do not exist here If a recipe specifically calls for an unaged Agricole you should just give up and skip it in my opinion Aged Agricoles offer a tiny bit more leeway Clement VSOP is rarely in stock in some liquor stores and is an acceptable choice if you re making something like Dots and a Dash However I would controversially suggest just using Barbancourt star instead due to its far greater availability and affordability Haiti does not have rules as stringent as Martinique AOC and their distillation process is somewhat different from what I understand but having both back to back I think it is a reasonable substitution for the subdued cane sugar profile Lightly aged Jamaican rum or dark Jamaican rum This isn t as glaring of a weakness in Canada but you will very often see recipes calling for something like Hamilton Pot Still Black Dr Bird Smith Cross etc in Tiki Drinks these days that I have never seen on the shelves in Canada They are highly praised for giving drinks a big molasses and dunder kick that stand up well in cocktails Now you could just use Appleton Estate Signature as it s a decent lightly aged Jamaican but in terms of flavor profile it will be missing a tonne of funky punch from all of those other rums My suggestion is if you see a cocktail using Smith and Cross or Hamilton black is to just mix one of the widely available unaged Jamaican Overproofs Rum Bar Wray and Nephew for some extra dunder punch with an aged or lightly aged dark Jamaican rum such as Coruba or Appleton to approximate the same color and keep your DIY blend Jamaican British Navy Rum For the life of me I cannot find Pusser s Gunpowder proof and Hamilton Navy is of course out of the question From what I understand Navy Rum historically changed over time and did not have a set and static blending but in terms of what we come to expect Navy Rum to mean in today s cocktail parlance is a rum that s around made up of demarara rum and Bajan and or Trinidad rum Understanding that ballpark we can then replicate something close by simply taking Lemon Hart and blending it with any of the Angostura offerings or Mount Gay Eclipse if you re in the mood for a Painkiller Playing to our Strengths We have one big advantage over our American counterparts in that we have easy access to pretty good Cuban rum in the form of Havana Club I propose that we get our mind out of the Tiki fascination more often and return to pre prohibition and pre Cuban revolution tradition Buy a bottle of HC and HC and go hog wild with Mary Pickford s Daiquiris Mojitos Cuba Libres El Presidentes etc I guarantee you these drinks are all delicious and simple and really highlight quality cuban rum Additionally for whatever reason aged DDL and Appleton products are relatively very cheap in Canada Now that El Dorado rums aren t dosed anymore there s no reason not to have a bottle of ED and Appleton when they re both Canadian consistently Those bottles together make a great if untraditional Mai Tai Wrap up What are your thoughts on Canada s rum availability Am I off the mark in your opinion in terms of what you can buy and what our biggest holes are Have you felt held back when trying to explore rum because of our availability problem or do you try and come up with solutions like seeking out very specialty stores or crossing the border to find staples that aren t available in Canada Do you find it worthwhile to try and make DIY substitutions like some of my examples in this post or is it a fool s errand For Americans that have access to all of the rums I mentioned in this post how realistic are my own substitutions and should I just not try and make a drink if it calls for a specific rum Thank you for reading and have

Help me chose a second Foursquare ECS cask series to try,I finally cracked my first bottle of Foursquare ECS and started drinking it the other day It has taken me several tastings to try to figure it out The nose is very hot very alcohol forward with notes of leather tobacco oak baking spices vanilla caramel and cocoa When I drink this I get many of those same notes plus hints of orange and additional spices but by the middle of the flavor palette I am hit with an overwhelming flavor of chocolate which continues into the finish very strongly I tried letting it rest for a bit adding a few drops of water or a small ice cube this opened it up a little bit to drop the heat and reveal a bit more oak on the backend but it still tastes like a pretty heavy chocolate bomb for my palette I am very interested in trying another bottling of the ECS series but I m not sure the best direction to go I want to see if another variant is perhaps more balanced I have access to Detent Nobiliary Empory Redoubtable Shibboleth and So which one to try next I don t have a huge budget for this so I would like to chose wisely ,2,Help me chose a second Foursquare ECS cask series to try I finally cracked my first bottle of Foursquare ECS and started drinking it the other day It has taken me several tastings to try to figure it out The nose is very hot very alcohol forward with notes of leather tobacco oak baking spices vanilla caramel and cocoa When I drink this I get many of those same notes plus hints of orange and additional spices but by the middle of the flavor palette I am hit with an overwhelming flavor of chocolate which continues into the finish very strongly I tried letting it rest for a bit adding a few drops of water or a small ice cube this opened it up a little bit to drop the heat and reveal a bit more oak on the backend but it still tastes like a pretty heavy chocolate bomb for my palette I am very interested in trying another bottling of the ECS series but I m not sure the best direction to go I want to see if another variant is perhaps more balanced I have access to Detent Nobiliary Empory Redoubtable Shibboleth and So which one to try next I don t have a huge budget for this so I would like to chose wisely

Beginner s thoughts on a few rums,Hey all I made a post a few weeks ago talking about my prior experience with rum and what my mindset should be when trying different kinds I had originally bought Plantation XO th Aniversary Edition and not enjoyed it the first two go rounds so I passed it off to a neighbor This time I purchased some other highly recommended rums with the intention of sticking to them and trying them on a more consistent basis So that s exactly what I ve been doing I started with trying the Diplomatico Reserva Exlucisva and all I can say is that I ve drained that bottle extremely quick After trying it a few times with and without ice I finally could taste the sweetness people had been talking about It was as smooth as others had mentioned and I loved it But it did take a few times of tasting it for me to finally enjoy it Next I tried the Dorado which I did find slightly sweeter but for me I also felt a slight burn and overall I felt more strongly towards the Diplomatica Tonight I went for the Appleton yr and enjoyed it as well Although it hasn t grown on me completely like the others have so at the moment the Diplomatica is still my favorite Anyways all of this was to say that sometimes it takes a couple of tries for people to begin experiencing the flavors and that if someone doesn t enjoy a glass of rum their first go around wait it out and try it a few nights later again and you may have different feelings towards it If anybody has some other drinks they recommend that would expand my palette a little further I wouldn t mind taking a look Have a good weekend all ,2,Beginner s thoughts on a few rums Hey all I made a post a few weeks ago talking about my prior experience with rum and what my mindset should be when trying different kinds I had originally bought Plantation XO th Aniversary Edition and not enjoyed it the first two go rounds so I passed it off to a neighbor This time I purchased some other highly recommended rums with the intention of sticking to them and trying them on a more consistent basis So that s exactly what I ve been doing I started with trying the Diplomatico Reserva Exlucisva and all I can say is that I ve drained that bottle extremely quick After trying it a few times with and without ice I finally could taste the sweetness people had been talking about It was as smooth as others had mentioned and I loved it But it did take a few times of tasting it for me to finally enjoy it Next I tried the Dorado which I did find slightly sweeter but for me I also felt a slight burn and overall I felt more strongly towards the Diplomatica Tonight I went for the Appleton yr and enjoyed it as well Although it hasn t grown on me completely like the others have so at the moment the Diplomatica is still my favorite Anyways all of this was to say that sometimes it takes a couple of tries for people to begin experiencing the flavors and that if someone doesn t enjoy a glass of rum their first go around wait it out and try it a few nights later again and you may have different feelings towards it If anybody has some other drinks they recommend that would expand my palette a little further I wouldn t mind taking a look Have a good weekend all

Looking for recommendation like Doorly s Chairman s Forgotten Casks,Hi TLDR I am looking for something which is similiar to Doorly s Chairman s Forgotten Casks Tested similiar Doorly s XO quite good Doorly s one dimensional paper taste Foursquare Detente didnt like earthiness Foursquare is just OK for me because I smell acetone Mount Gay XO could be darker its like sweet chocolate nice gone too fast Hechicera too bright Chairman s Legacy too herbal and smooth Chairman s also has herbal note which bothers me otherwise it is very good Trying to not exceed Doorly s or Foursquare price Blabla longer section After tasting a lot of rums it seems I like these the best but I would like to explore a little bit more I definitely like darker chocolate raisin woody notes What I liked the most Forgotten Casks I like it a lot as it is like dark chocolate yet non bitter and woody for me but lacks flavour could be stronger Doorly s I find this the best smells like XO and blend though expensive Doorly s I like it a lot but it could be darker stronger HMS Princessa actually sometimes I like it better than Forgotten Casks as it has more flavour A little bit too sweet Quite good Doorly s XO quite good but there is some weird bitterness Maybe it is sherry finish I noticed I can t stand rums like Maderos or Abuelo due to wine earthy notes but on the other hand I can stand Cartavio and I actually like Flor De Cana Less flavour than imo Foursquare after a while it becomes better and with a coke I actually prefer it to Doorly s but my nose picks acetone Mount Gay XO new version triple cask too sweet not much wood dissapears quickly Not my cup of tea Doorly s this is weird for me it tastes like essence of Doorly s like somebody wanted to clearly show the main note of and extracted it and only it one dimensional smells a little bit like paper I even prefer Doorly s Foursquare Detente earthy dark notes though I like the fact that it is missing that strong acetone smell which I am picking in Chairman s Reserve wow that has a lot of flavour I actually almost liked it but there is some herbal part whcih I dont like it slightly reminds me Mexican Mint or Cuban Oregano oleus amboinicus I can t get that out of my head now Strong but no acetone note at all Chairman s Legacy honey herbs actually a lot of flavour for that price but too herbal too bright Chairman s Edition for some european shop John Dore i Vendome too much herb weird fruits its like upgraded Legacy Mount Gay Black Barrel not much of flavour a bit alcoholic My wishlist based on the above HMS Formidable HMS Royal Oak Chairman s did anybody compare this to Forgotten Casks I wonder if it has same herbal or weird fruit note as Legacy R L Seale English Harbour or English Harbour Madeira as I Doorly s is supposedly Madeira I might try also Worthy Park as I got such recommendation as I also like a bit funk Wishlist others Mezan Xo Jamaica Blackwell Fine La Maison Venezuela or some other Plantation Dark Original Quorhum a lot of people recommended this but I am afraid it will be like a lot of Rons which I find watery Wood s old navy hope it wont be like pussers looking for OFTD So far liked Appleton

My thoughts on the Redoutable Spicy , I cracked this one open at the weekend to see what it was like I have a bottle of the Diadem in the cupboard so was interested to see how they would fare side by side both being of a similar finish Some of these Foursquare releases do seem to settle with slightly different flavours after a few weeks so am wondering how it will mellow I had a couple tastes over the weekend to try and get a bit of an understanding of the nuances Nose Standard Foursquare nail varnish offering zesty citrus lime red tropical fruit Oak Adding a few drops of water brings out more of the zesty fruit Back by popular demand my year old daughter s thoughts of the nose dirty smelly fruit D Taste The initial entry is sweet fruit which almost immediately transitions to the oak characteristic Red fruits are detectable in a similar vein to the port finish probably from the madeira cask but it is definitely not as prominent There is some muted brown sugar in the background but this one isn t as sweet as the The oak is quite strong and bitter and there is a definite black pepper note that is quite forward What immediate strikes me about this rum is the spiciness think chili heat wow my tongue is on fire even with some extra added drops of water Aftertaste Relatively short lived for a Foursquare offering the spicy burn on my tongue lasts for a while though Black pepper on the finish with dry oak and a tiny bit of the madeira influence The Redoutable currently is very astringent and drying in my mouth I did find that when I initially opened the I had the same issue but the effect did dissipate after a while I m wondering if the Redoutable will do the same This rum is less sweet than most of the other recent offerings Diadem aged for years bourbon madeira vs Redoutable aged for years bourbon madeira With the spicy afterburn of the Redoutable still fresh in my mouth added drops of water in the Redoutable to tame it I poured a small measure of the Diadem from the bottle Bearing in mind that the Diadem is drinking it straight actually cooled my mouth down from the Redoutable The Diadem and Redoutable main body flavours are very similar given that they are both bourbon madeira aged I would suggest that the highlights are what differ somewhat Compared to the Redoutable the Diadem is more mellow and has more of an orange with a bit of dark chocolate whereas the Redoutable is a spicy hot black pepper oak The flavour of the Redoutable wasn t really what I had expected especially that spiciness I m interested to see if the flavours change as I get more used to it and now that the bottle is open ,2,My thoughts on the Redoutable Spicy   I cracked this one open at the weekend to see what it was like I have a bottle of the Diadem in the cupboard so

Rum in Barbados Mini Travel Guide, Rum selection at Tapas Christ Church Barbados Dec Heading to Barbados Don t go now but take note for your future trip This post includes info about distilleries stores and restaurants Distilleries MOUNT GAY The distillery is in the north part of the island but they have a tasting room in Bridgetown The staff is amazing and it is worth doing to premium tasting rums at the tasting room in addition to the distillery tour on separate days You won t end up drinking much at the distillery at least we didn t The staff is amazing and it appears to be a humble operation despite the worldwide distribution and Remy Martin parent company They were transparent about adding coloring to the regular releases to promote visual consistency but that is not done to their special one off releases The current new master blender is a local woman in her s who apprenticed under the previous master blender Buying rum There is more for sale at the tasting room but the distillery might have some more unique products Cash only at the distillery Credit is accepted at the tasting room FOURSQUARE About minutes from the airport in the southern part of the island It feels a bit like Disneyland Super impressive and massive operation Great group of people working there Not sure what it is like during non pandemic times but there were parking spots for tour buses The tasting afterwards was very casual and educational Don t miss it Buying rum Credit accepted Unfortunately the selection was bare There were a few ECS bottles that could easily be found in the US ST NICHOLAS ABBEY Beautiful piece of property near Mount Gay The train ride is a bit cheesy but quite educational There wasn t much going on at the distillery It was more of a self guided tour with a few signs Certain times of year they crush sugar cane which visitors can observe The owner poured rum samples for us in the house they will engrave purchased bottles with any message you d like Older batches were produced by Foursquare maybe year old which are pricey Buying rum Credit accepted They are expensive and we were only able to sample a few WEST INDIES RUM DISTILLERY This is where Plantation is made Rumor has it they are working on opening it up for tours Local stores There are multiple WINE WORLD locations with decent selections We got a cool looking Plantation tasting set for like US tasting it was not that fun You won t find much Foursquare ECS but you ll see Doorly s and their other brands like Old Brigand Grocery stores like Massy have good selections as well AIRPORT shops these have decent selections But don t bank on it If you want something from Mount Gay you can find it but the Foursquare selection likely changes often When we went to board they plane they asked us to fit our duty free stuff into our carry on bags that was more of a formality just stuff it in and then remove it once you are on the plane Restaurants The main one you need to check out is Tapas see above photo as they have a whole menu for Foursquare Their food is good too It s a classy joint with a great view The cocktails aren t bad either Wherever you go scope out the bar We found a Foursquare bottle at the Atlantis hotel restaurant I m sure other older bottles are hiding out at random spots Rum bars Barbados is full of little rum bars which are mostly for locals This is an economical option if you re not into the touristy spots which can be expensive These bars sell little bottles of rum along with beer and most things you d expect to find at a dive bar You ll also get a bowl of ice and bottle of water We liked John Moore Bar which is north on the west coast it s more of a shack but the vibe is great We found some old mini bottles of Mount Gay Mauby which hasn t been produced since Some of these spots have good food too check out the fish cutters sandwiches Misc tips and tricks Tap water in Barbados is great and safe to drink Don t waste plastic or money on bottled water Bajan is pronounced like Asian with a B in front of it Try mauby a drink made from bark Try sorrel hibiscus drinks Bring home local sugar so you can make your own Bajan Rum Punch But don t bring sugar in your carry on bag mine was taken by security for some reason That said I was able to buy some overpriced local sugar in the airport You ll probably want to rent a car Drive on the

So I learned what funk is last night ,I have been sampling the various styles of rum over the last few months to figure out what I enjoy most I ve tried plenty of Bajan Agricole Demerara and a Venezuelan but I was hesitant to dive into Jamaican In trying to figure out what funk is and whether or not I would like it it became clear that it s one of those things you can only understand by tasting it So taste it I did When selecting my first Jamaican I had a hard time picking out the right bottle Appleton is popular but apparently more woody than funky Doctor Bird sounded good but my local shop didn t have it Wray Nephew Overproof received high marks but I don t know if I can handle that for sipping Same with Smith and Cross I have really enjoyed sipping on Probitas or Veritas lately which has some Hampden in its blend The cheapest Hampden available to me was their year not overproof at but I figured it was worth a shot I pulled the trigger and had my first glass Here are my thoughts It s weird It is indeed funky Some have compared funkiness to overripe bananas but that didn t come through as much for me on this tasting Some reviews I read said this rum has notes of burnt rubber and glue which seemed silly yet they were right There is this chemical sort of flavor reminiscent of some pungent non food items There were some milder fruity notes but for a first taste the esters were overwhelming I ll admit it was hard to enjoy I really wanted to enjoy it I could tell that it was an excellent rum in the Jamaican tradition What do you think Was this a bad starting point for Jamaican rum Will I learn to like it How would you mix this if at all Cheers ,2,So I learned what funk is last night  I have been sampling the various styles of rum over the last few months to figure out what I enjoy most I ve tried plenty of Bajan Agricole Demerara and a Venezuelan but I was hesitant to dive into Jamaican In trying to figure out what funk is and whether or not I would like it it became clear that it s one of those things you can only understand by tasting it So taste it I did When selecting my first Jamaican I had a hard time picking out the right bottle Appleton is popular but apparently more woody than funky Doctor Bird sounded good but my local shop didn t have it Wray Nephew Overproof received high marks but I don t know if I can handle that for sipping Same with Smith and Cross I have really enjoyed sipping on Probitas or Veritas lately which has some Hampden in its blend The cheapest Hampden available to me was their year not overproof at but I figured it was worth a shot I pulled the trigger and had my first glass Here are my thoughts It s weird It is indeed funky Some have compared funkiness to overripe bananas but that didn t come through as much for me on this tasting Some reviews I read said this rum has notes of burnt rubber and glue which seemed silly yet they were right There is this chemical sort of flavor reminiscent of some pungent non food items There were some milder fruity notes but for a first taste the esters were overwhelming I ll admit it was hard to enjoy I really wanted to enjoy it I could tell that it was an excellent rum in the Jamaican tradition What do you think Was this a bad starting point for Jamaican rum Will I learn to like it How would you mix this if at all Cheers

How to Tip Toe Back into Jamaican Rum ,A few years back I had a bad experience with Appleton It was absolutely delicious and I loved the slightly funky notes but maybe I enjoyed it too much one night and since then the thought of it turns stomach I really miss that funk though and especially for use in cocktails though having a nice sipper would be great too I would love to make the effort to find out how to love Jamaican rum again Does anyone have any ideas on some good bottles for me to dip my toes back into those funky Jamaican waters Do I try something light or go for a funk bomb like Smith and Cross Maybe something identifiably Jamaican but different enough from Appleton to not trigger any memories I one day hope to get back to enjoying Appleton and similar rums but I think I ve got a long road ahead of me Before posting I did see some old posts about intro Jamaican funk but I figured my particular situation was different enough to try a new post If it s not sorry I ll be happy to take it down PS While we are on the topic what would you consider to be the prototypical Jamaican rum ,2,How to Tip Toe Back into Jamaican Rum  A few years back I had a bad experience with Appleton It was absolutely delicious and I loved the slightly funky notes but maybe I enjoyed it too much one night and since then the thought of it turns stomach I really miss that funk though and especially for use in cocktails though having a nice sipper would be great too I would love to make the effort to find out how to love Jamaican rum again Does anyone have any ideas on some good bottles for me to dip my toes back into those funky Jamaican waters Do I try something light or go for a funk bomb like Smith and Cross Maybe something identifiably Jamaican but different enough from Appleton to not trigger any memories I one day hope to get back to enjoying Appleton and similar rums but I think I ve got a long road ahead of me Before posting I did see some old posts about intro Jamaican funk but I figured my particular situation was different enough to try a new post If it s not sorry I ll be happy to take it down PS While we are on the topic what would you consider to be the prototypical Jamaican rum

So I listened to your advice time for me to tell you about my experience ,About a month ago I posted on r rum because I really couldn t make heads or tails of the entire world of rum and was considering sampling a lot of plantations I have been drinking whisky for years but was recently introduced to the world of good rum by a Dutch independent bottler the Duchess So you guys gave me advice and I am now the slightly embarrassed owner of around bottles of rum So I did a couple of comparative tastings and wanted to let you know what my findings are Bear in mind I am a total novice Feel free to correct me disagree with me or provide me with more advice Your input was awesome last time so I trust any comments on this post to be similarly welcoming First group Barbados Plantation XO Bought before I posted and I didn t appreciate it much Very sweet lots of coconut orange no balance The spice was alright though Arbitrary score Mount Gay XO Much much better it actually feels like it has wood character like a very good whisky I get cinnamon and mocha with fudge and prunes It is a lot better than the plantation Mount Gay yo The Duchess really different from the XO Much drier apples citrus and vanilla dominate with almonds and a slightly bitter finish I like the XO better Foursquare fruity spicy Strawberries orange ginger and a little pepper Very well balanced and layered Evolution in the glass Doorly Bought because it is also Foursquare but less than half the price But completely different A lot of caramel with chocolate and apricot Remins me of Werther s Concluding Despite their price cask strength Foursquare still might be my favourite value for money Second Group Jamaica Plantation Xaymaca Nice rum combining aniseed and orange Not complex Not bad Plantation Clarendon yo The reason I thought Plantation was a brilliant company Still love it nice balance of fruit flavors citrus banana bread with spice like vanilla and clove Wray and Nephew White rum By far the best white rum I have ever tasted It has notes of brown sugar apple even some banana in the back It still doesn t compare to the others for lack of complexity but it s good and interesting I m happy you guys told me about this No score Appleton Good but light Peach hazelnuts and mint Nice balance between fruit and wood character Still I need more Goslings Black Seal not Jamaica I know Very unique Preposterous ABV but watered down it s not any good Gingerbread liquorice root dutch butter cake Very unique Nice experience Concluding I am fascinated by Jamaican rum Would like to try more I am unsure whether I managed to buy any truly funky rum Am now contemplating Smith and Cross Monymusk CS Rum fire and Appleton Signature Third Group Spanish style rum Brugal Not as sweet as I was expecting Buttery blackberries vanilla and nutmeg Nice spice El dorado Tropical fruit mango pistachio sugar candy It s very fruity changes in the glass with air and I appreciate it a lot Angostura Well that s not good An odd amalgamation of different sweet flavours with a flowery bouquet Crème Brulee Much too sweet Why did I buy this again Diplomatico Mantuano I risky bet cause the reserve exclusive my mate let me taste was dreadful But this is much better I get coffee cherries figs It s sweet but not overly so Also somewhat to light for my tastes Conclusion Spanish style rum is risky These guys love their sugar I should find some cask strength versions And what exactly defines demerara is not apparent to me from the El Dorado Fourth group French style Agricole Clement VSOP Very light rum grassy flavour vanilla parsley Like lowlands whisky The Duchess Ten Cane yo Trinidad but still Agricole Like it a lot Cane sugar like cachaca honey and grapes slightly peppery The Duchess Rhumerie du Simon yo Lighter on the cane sugar strong vanilla citrus fruit Good but not like the Ten cane The Duchess Bellevue yo might be French style but not Agricole Very fruity some of the best spirit I have tasted in my life including very expensive whiskies It has oak character with nuts berries and orange with spice and cinnamon Conclusion I might not have gotten the concept straight French rum does not equal Agricole Getting Agricole in the Netherlands is actually pretty hard despite our proximity to France So these were mostly IB s and I am unsure how well they represent the style Final thoughts All in all I consider rum a very enjoyable new hobby And oh boy are these rums cheap when you are used to whisky That Appleton sells for euro the Diplomatico Mantuano for euro El dorado probably the best value for money I have ever bought in any alcoholic beverage Mount Gay XO euro I do feel I would probably appreciate many of these rums better as sippers at higher ABV s If

Review Damoiseau VSOP, This is a self styled agricole Vieux style rum from Guadeloupe bottled at going for around ml and was sent to me as a sample from a generous redditor I ve had a bit of a mixed bag trying out agricole style rums but the Vieux aged ones have been mostly favorable Let s see how this is You really can smell this from across the table it is pungent with fruity esters candied plum comes to mind This smells awfully sweet for my prior experiences with agricoles like a sweet fruit syrup Definitely some orange peel and vanilla on the nose as well A bit earthy but not much I d peg this as a Vieux in a blind I think but it doesn t retain a ton of that fresh grassy thing It really drinks between like a year old Bacardi fruity citrus column still and the agricole vieuxs I ve tried Fruit and citrus in equal measure and not nearly as sweet as the nose suggested Surprisingly more citrus than fruit in the finish and a bit of warmth but this isn t hot What a weird rum I wouldn t run out for a backup of the same bottle but I wouldn t be mad I bought it It s nice interesting a bit weird with the style confusion to me at least and an easy drinker I love the warmth on it and just how much citrus I m getting I d say it s priced well It s not my favorite style so that may bias me against it a bit but I do think it s a bit above average Similar things I like a little more Clement Vieux store pick Similar things I like a little less Rhum J M V S O P ,2,Review Damoiseau VSOP  This is a self styled agricole Vieux style rum from Guadeloupe bottled at going for around ml and was sent to me as a sample from a generous redditor I ve had a bit of a mixed bag trying out agricole style rums but the Vieux aged ones have been mostly favorable Let s see how this is You really can smell this from across the table it is pungent with fruity esters candied plum comes to mind This smells awfully sweet for my prior experiences with agricoles like a sweet fruit syrup Definitely some orange peel and vanilla on the nose as well A bit earthy but not much I d peg this as a Vieux in a blind I think but it doesn t retain a ton of that fresh grassy thing It really drinks between like a year old Bacardi fruity citrus column still and the agricole vieuxs I ve tried Fruit and citrus in equal measure and not nearly as sweet as the nose suggested Surprisingly more citrus than fruit in the finish and a bit of warmth but this isn t hot What a weird rum I wouldn t run out for a backup of the same bottle but I wouldn t be mad I bought it It s nice interesting a bit weird with the style confusion to me at least and an easy drinker I love the warmth on it and just how much citrus I m getting I d say it s priced well It s not my favorite style so that may bias me against it a bit but I do think it s a bit above average Similar things I like a little more Clement Vieux store pick Similar things I like a little less Rhum J M V S O P

A lockdown review Daily sipper contest,Hello Redditer Throughout the past year I ve started a more serious rum journey and this reddit has been a decent part of it As you could assume the lock down gives sometimes a bit of extra free time And working in hospitality and having a lock down gives an extra bit of too much free time I always appreciated rum reviews and found that this subreddit can offer some lovely one Much more than any Facebook group that is merely people showing off bottles with no interesting info or tasting After reading so much here and sometimes commenting I thought that I could do a bit more during the new month ish lock down that UK is having by getting my recent tasting review written Nothing fancy nothing truly pro but something worthy to add to the subreddit I hope Here I am having a go at some of my first bottles ever bought Contestants will be Zacapa Xo I bought that one for on sale I thought I would enjoy it Never been disappointed that much by a bottle I think Got beaten blind by a doorly s xo Since then I refuse to get involved with zacapa Main info I have from it is that it is kind of the zacapa aged further years in cognac barrels Minimum age seems to be years hence an XO But still a Solera system so not that old overall Aged in high altitude and made with virgin sugar cane honey Seemed fancy at first But truly it s a way to say we use cane syrup like the french guys and we are on high altitude so our angel share is lower in the end It uses additive in any sorts caramel colorant and sugar Isn t it a lovely looking bottle Actually wait is that gross plastic painted gold The closer you get the cheaper it looks Glass and nose caramel like color Sweet nose soft tones Not aggressive and a tiny bit of complexity Hint of fall in here sweaty wood and mid dry fallen leaves Then the cognac makes it entrance dried prunes and figs with some roasted spicy wood It doesn t smell fresh but it is quite alright Mouth Nutty Sweet but pleasant Dries out quickly than the entry makes you think thanks to a good waves of tannin The prunes are still here Medium finish silky and liquor ish Rhum JM xo What is now my go to Tiny bit expensive compared to a Teresa or Doorly s but nonetheless so great I bought it after realizing how different an aged agricole was I had an eye opening taste of Clement VSOP I had the white JM at work quite special So I went for this xo Here is a classic french xo agricole cane syrup on a colonne savalle yo minimum Bourbon cask The nose is less sweet it seems younger and at first more aggressive Past it the bourbon cask is giving a lot Behind it comes some herbal notes not unlike the white version though less grassy a tamed JM then but spicier than the Zacapa more complex and fresh on the nose Not too strong on the palate a good deal of wood Quite dry with much less tanin than Z It would be an ok rum if it wasn t for the finish This is glorious the green papaya fresh vanilla tiny spices cardamom like and a never ending delicious mango staying in the back of your tong and taste bud like it s gonna start to live there Santa Teresa My ron of choice back in the day Bought one bottle and got drunk quite quickly since I offered it a lot to guests and brought it back to my workplace as after shift drink I like the fact that they don t bullsh t you It is solera aged but no weird number on the label No sugar or really a little And decently priced Also massively distributed Nose Sweet and soft like a Zacapa a tiny bit bland to be honest not fresh not strong but a decent one It smells toasted like a good ron usually smells to me The mouth is also soft not too sweet light and easy To be honest I am still tasting my JM xo through the santa teresa wrong order for the rum tasting eh A bit of caramel hint of spiced through the alcohol and then gone I ve had many rum since I first tasted that one and now it is not as good as I thought it would be I will still be happy with it though It does what we are asking for Easygoing and inoffensive Doorly s Foursquare needs little introduction I had a full doorly s xo before that which was my real gateway rum and bought the not so long after I absolutely loved it at first Still likes it but it can seem a tad light to me now We have a year old rum madeira cask bourbon cask No sugar added Nose Rummy smell Later Foursquare smell would become my standard in oh that smells like rum no The madeira cask and pot still content are noticeable Especially after a santa teresa Strong and flavorfull nose that can matches JM XO Difficult to put word on it but I decided to qualify that as fruit and spiced biscuit Like Speculos if you are familiar with it It smells fresh and pleasant Easy on the palate sweet entrance with tropical fruits and then fully dry onto a good medium finish Conclusion If I were to sort them it would look a bit like JM xo Doorly s Santa Teresa Zacapa xo If I were to add notes I would give them None are truly bad in my opinion The Zacapa Xo is way too expensive for what it can offers so I would advise people to not bother about it My flatmate whom I thank for the picture kept hearing me every time I was trying it damn So disappointing I gave my best try to this bottle But most of it went through dark and stormy I will always have a JM xo or vintage open in my house It has become a real pleasure and favorite Santa Teresa is alright It does the job and I use it a lot in cocktail actually It is a rum to offer to non rum drinker or as a gateway rum in my opinion Doorly s is also quite alright Less tasty than a JM xo but also a totally different rum way cheaper and maybe more widely available Hence quite close in my rating It is a great classic anyway Thanks for reading stay safe y all ,2,A

Review Holmes Cay Guyana, About the Rum Holmes Cay Guyana Port Mourant Demerara comes from a single cask of rum distilled on the famous Port Mourant double wooden pot still at Demerara Distillers in Guyana in Aged for years in the UK in recycled American oak rum casks Bottled by the independent bottler Holmes Cay in New York at cask strength ABV with no water coloring sugar or flavors added bottles produced Overall Assessment For me this rum is a on a scale of to see full explanation of rating system below for further context I enjoyed it but am not going to rush out to acquire a full bottle On the Nose The nose has a lot going on and is by far the best part of this rum The alcohol is well integrated and it s easy to nose It initially comes off as vaguely Jamaican to me Several different fruits all slightly tempered by the oak unripe bananas green apple peels and bosc pear skins Then nail polish remover and recently waxed mahogany Savory notes of mild licorice root and kalamata olive juice Sweet notes of brown sugar cubes and caramelized bananas Finishes off with crumbled graham crackers well toasted coconut macaroons and a dusting of fine cocoa powder On the Palate In the mouth this is enjoyable but not nearly as complex as the nose led me to expect Wonder if maybe the oak is covering things up I did however love the unctuous oily mouthfeel Has a peaty entry initially very Scotch like That gives way to some brief banana notes which are then buried beneath a savory avalanche of fennel pork salami and a hint of just opened anchovy tin Fine oak tannins dry things out as the finish kicks in On the Finish A warm and pleasant finish that blossoms quickly and disappears even more quickly Found the length of the finish and the lack of complexity a bit disappointing The waxed mahogany notes from the nose and the oily mouthfeel turn into freshly broken wax seal on the finish A whiff of peat returns and the fennel pork salami morphs into caraway seeds

Minimalist Tiki by Matt Pietrek u CocktailWonk Carrie Smith,After tearing through the pages of Minimalist Tiki I wanted to write a short and amateur review of it for the subs I frequent I m not affiliated in any way with the author I just liked the book You probably already own Smuggler s Cove and if you re like me you didn t feel the immediate need to check out other works on the same subject but let me tell you why you should This book does a much better deep dive into Rum itself Let s start with the shallow before we dive into the deep and acknowledge the beauty of this book They obviously have a great eye for visuals and photography or at least photographers and that extends well past the cover The photographs are stunning and printed in high resolution It s a beautiful tabletop tome They include not only pretty pictures of bottles and bars and cocktails but also informative pictures of tanks of molasses stills sugar cane etc This book is also exceptional for people new to tiki cocktails It s wonderfully minimal as it s title states They lay out golden era cocktails you should know and do an amazing job letting you know how frequently ingredients for those appear in the cocktails and also which cocktails use what so you can sync up what you re buying with your favorite tiki drinks What this does is let new somewhat new to tiki know what to buy to START in which they ll get the biggest bang for their buck First rum purchase and looking to make tiki drinks Don t make it an agricole For me this was not nearly as obvious in the Smuggler s Cove book but Minimalist Tiki gets straight to the meat of what I want to know It also has whole chapters on technique equipment garnishes syrups and on and on The beauty of this book is answering the questions you had when you bought the book which it does wonderfully It goes into their own rum classification which I personally prefer to the SC one It gives specific rum recommendations for you to pick up but also makes it clear what else works The book goes into rum with a very deep dive I m up over bottles of rum yo ho ho and have tried around double that I ve also read Smuggler s Cove cover to cover I learned a lot about rum reading this book Some highlights for me were the process of turning sugar cane into fermentable distillable sugars and the bit about Agricole being a seasonal product It also goes into the distilling process in a deeper way than I ve heard it explained which goes into the types of stills what makes Jamaican rum funky the heads and tails of distilling and so much more It also covers the following processes of barrel aging and on and on even to the producers and merchant bottlers and independent bottlers It also covers something I thought was really cool which is the locations of distillers and the ways you could find out who the PRODUCER is of the rums on the shelf Some rum brands don t make rum I found that a little mind blowing but it s explained well in the book and we re told how to figure out as much as we can who makes what Beyond all that if you needed more The book goes into new recipes and The New Tiki Vanguard of bartenders and bars giving the fresh lay of the land of now and the future of tiki A lot of really interesting recipes are included in a refreshingly straight forward format The book ends with new riffs on it s essential recipes many of which sound great and I look forward to drinking my way through in the coming months My only complaint would be that they left out the actual recipe s of their essential cocktails In the book they reference leaving them out for the sake of brevity and flow and them being from Beachbum Berry s Total Tiki app That app though is iPhone iPad only however which is a bit of a shame as someone with an Android phone These recipes aren t hard to find online or through the Mixel app w tiki pack which is what I already had but since the focus for newbies are on these cocktails I would have preferred they be self contained within the book In summary it s a book worth a purchase even if you have other tiki books New to Tiki Get this Want a beautiful coffee table tiki book Get this Want to

Foursquare Velier judgment day de sulphuring Hereditas Appleton vs El Dorado,So recently I made a post in which I asked what is the deal with Foursquare Velier it is x of the price of ECS in the UK What is up I have a Patrimonio for a special occasion but I can t bust that one open yet So the suggestion was to buy samples which I am totally against I will not pay a x markup per ml and definitely not in a bar At master of malt I bought some that were cheap a sample because some are good value and I want some of those nice sturdy ml bottles Anyway surprising rhum attitude in france has the best prices for samples I have seen anywhere For the more expensive bottles euros I think their markup per ml can be or less depending on the bottle So I ordered samples and got one for free even yo Diamond First downside cheap bottles These cannot be re used Bummer I have taken a bit of a break from rum so to get back into it I will start with a sample that has always had a question mark on it and it is El Dorado I had it in a fancy restaurant and loved it but didn t want to buy a bottle because they add sugar Now sipping it in the afternoon right before a bunch of zoom meetings I have to say it is not as classy as I remember it being in that expensive vancouver sushi restaurant It is too fake sweet I expect a longer finish I appreciate the muted funk To me funk is a bit like smoke in scotch something you can get addicted to in young spirit and the ultimate class if it fades and matures over decades in the cask So let s turn it into a tasting by comparing it to the Appleton I also ordered I promise the rest is all Velier Surprisingly similar the biggest difference is that all the sugar is removed Much dryer on arrival and finish a good hit of oak I expected more funk These two beg to be compared abv age price price is identical in france and vs in UK wtf They are very close for me I think I will find more in the Appleton if I give them more time The sugarless integrity choice anyhow With a bit of time I think the Appleton clearly takes it It makes me happy that there are consistent available options Off to the main act I am PUMPED now to get into the Velier releases I was able to order Principia and Plenipotentiazrio were the only Foursquare Velier releases I was able to secure Then Royal Navy Tiger Shark and Royal Navy LMDW I would usually never buy bottles with so little info for so much money Mount Gay Last Ward Habitation Velier and a month of Clairin are the Veliers in the other category Plenipotentiazio vs blind I was able to guess which one the Velier is because I know well but also because it is smoother and more muted It has the perfumy part of the oak that Pappy also has and reminds me a bit of BTAC in general Maybe because I also never owned a full bottle of btac I drink it in a different frame of mind has a bigger hit of flavour but also is harsher Fuck I think it is clearly but narrowly better Maybe better for x the price makes you take breaks and get used to it a bit Pleni P is like liquid icecream that you can just drink until it kills you Will I buy a bottle Probably not but I am pumped I have the whole bottle of patrimonio This confirms a little bit my impression that Foursquare is like buffalo trace it can produce a very cheap bottle and it can produce a highly expensive product that are produced in the identical way the difference is the barrel selection not what barrels to put the spirit in but which ones you after the fact select to bottle From the enormous stock cherry picking the barrels that turned out the best after years makes a huge difference My suspicion is that the main dimension of selection is smoothness actually yeah I said it When people say the pappy of rum they mean the hype but I think it is true in two additional ways too Principia vs Hereditas blind First of all my hereditas is a sulphur bomb Imagine having a nice sherried foursquare on the edge of a vulcano I have put ml in a small bottle and added copper wires for a week to oxidize the sulphur I predicted the wire would turn black but the wire stays clear and now there is a fair amount of residue in the flask So in order to give the Principia a worthy opponent we first need to do Hereditas raw vs Hereditas post copper wire treatment blind So the biggest issue is that the copperwired Hereditas remains cloudy even after filtering it through a very very fine sieve I can immediately tell which one got the treatment Yes less sulphur great But its weird sour tastes a bit like pennies terrible mouth feel Reminds me of when I butter washed bourbon and I didn t like the result So a waste of ml of hereditas But the original is still too sulphury to really enjoy Maybe the next step is to oxidize it heavily Hereditas raw vs Principia blind I can immediately tell which one is which No sulphur great But if pleni P is pappy Principia is a older Knob Creek store pick There is the same perfumy note again but the whole thing is hotter and there is a woody note that strikes me as off early Sipping Principia and Pleni side my side makes me feel like doing bourbon tastings to me it is never about how the bourbons distinguish each other positively but just about their flaws that differ wood notes that are too much like resin or harsh and dry Those tastings are not nearly as fun as single malt where I think they can differ more in positive and specific notes that set them apart So Velier Foursquare mixed so far Unlike ECS these are not blind buys for me I think For this price it needs to be either consistently subtly better or really in a different league I am now worried the Patrimonio will be too much like the Principia All of this was done in a bit of a rush I am glad the samples are cl so I get a bit more time with these without the blind comparisons Overall what this exercise did was cure me a bit of my fomo and rum fever and this feeling that I am passing on these rare black bottles and will regret it in the future Good stuff but not on a different plane of existence I think what I really want to taste is foursquare aged in scotland in a refill cask for years PS the clairin

deal with Foursquare Velier it is x of the price of ECS in the UK What is up I have a Patrimonio for a special occasion but I can t bust that one open yet So the suggestion was to buy samples which I am totally against I will not pay a x markup per ml and definitely not in a bar At master of malt I bought some that were cheap a sample because some are good value and I want some of those nice sturdy ml bottles Anyway surprising rhum attitude in france has the best prices for samples I have seen anywhere For the more expensive bottles euros I think their markup per ml can be or less depending on the bottle So I ordered samples and got one for free even yo Diamond First downside cheap bottles These cannot be re used Bummer I have taken a bit of a break from rum so to get back into it I will start with a sample that has always had a question mark on it and it is El Dorado I had it in a fancy restaurant and loved it but didn t want to buy a bottle because they add sugar Now sipping it in the afternoon right before a bunch of zoom meetings I have to say it is not as classy as I remember it being in that expensive vancouver sushi restaurant It is too fake sweet I expect a longer finish I appreciate the muted funk To me funk is a bit like smoke in scotch something you can get addicted to in young spirit and the ultimate class if it fades and matures over decades in the cask So let s turn it into a tasting by comparing it to the Appleton I also ordered I promise the rest is all Velier Surprisingly similar the biggest difference is that all the sugar is removed Much dryer on arrival and finish a good hit of oak I expected more funk These two beg to be compared abv age price price is identical in france and vs in UK wtf They are very close for me I think I will find more in the Appleton if I give them more time The sugarless integrity choice anyhow With a bit of time I think the Appleton clearly takes it It makes me happy that there are consistent available options Off to the main act I am PUMPED now to get into the Velier releases I was able to order Principia and Plenipotentiazrio were the only Foursquare Velier releases I was able to secure Then Royal Navy Tiger Shark and Royal Navy LMDW I would usually never buy bottles with so little info for so much money Mount Gay Last Ward Habitation Velier and a month of Clairin are the Veliers in the other category Plenipotentiazio vs blind I was able to guess which one the Velier is because I know well but also because it is smoother and more muted It has the perfumy part of the oak that Pappy also has and reminds me a bit of BTAC in general Maybe because I also never owned a full bottle of btac I drink it in a different frame of mind has a bigger hit of flavour but also is harsher Fuck I think it is clearly but narrowly better Maybe better for x the price makes you take breaks and get used to it a bit Pleni P is like liquid icecream that you can just drink until it kills you Will I buy a bottle Probably not but I am pumped I have the whole bottle of patrimonio This confirms a little bit my impression that Foursquare is like buffalo trace it can produce a very cheap bottle and it can produce a highly expensive product that are produced in the identical way the difference is the barrel selection not what barrels to put the spirit in but which ones you after the fact select to bottle From the enormous stock cherry picking the barrels that turned out the best after years makes a huge difference My suspicion is that the main dimension of selection is smoothness actually yeah I said it When people say the pappy of rum they mean the hype but I think it is true in two additional ways too Principia vs Hereditas blind First of all my hereditas is a sulphur bomb Imagine having a nice sherried foursquare on the edge of a vulcano I have put ml in a small bottle and added copper wires for a week to oxidize the sulphur I predicted the wire would turn black but the wire stays clear and now there is a fair amount of residue in the flask So in order to give the Principia a worthy opponent we first need to do Hereditas raw vs Hereditas post copper wire treatment blind So the biggest issue is that the copperwired Hereditas remains cloudy even after filtering it through a very very fine sieve I can immediately tell which one got the treatment Yes less sulphur great But its weird sour tastes a bit like pennies terrible mouth feel Reminds me of when I butter washed bourbon and I didn t like the result So a waste of ml of hereditas But the original is still too sulphury to really enjoy Maybe the next step is to oxidize it heavily Hereditas raw vs Principia blind I can immediately tell which one is which No sulphur great But if pleni P is pappy Principia is a older Knob Creek store pick There is the same perfumy note again but the whole thing is hotter and there is a woody note that strikes me as off early Sipping Principia and Pleni side my side makes me feel like doing bourbon tastings to me it is never about how the bourbons distinguish each other positively but just about their flaws that differ wood notes that are too much like resin or harsh and dry Those tastings are not nearly as fun as single malt where I think they can differ more in positive and specific notes that set them apart So Velier Foursquare mixed so far Unlike ECS these are not blind buys for me I think For this price it needs to be either consistently subtly better or really in a different league I am now worried the Patrimonio will be too much like the Principia All of this was done in a bit of a rush I am glad the samples are cl so I get a bit more time with these without the blind comparisons Overall what this exercise did was cure me a bit of my fomo and rum fever and this feeling that I am passing on these rare black bottles and will regret it in the future Good stuff but not on a different plane of existence I think what I really want to taste is foursquare aged in scotland in a refill cask for years PS the clairin tastes like these herb encrusted goats cheeses damn that is weird

This rum is a blend of pot and column still John Dore and column It s then aged for years in ex bourbon casks and bottled without chill filtration at an admirable ABV take note ers This is a no bullshit rum to be sure but it doesn t cut corners She s a classy broad this one but she ll show you around Nose On the nose I was surprised at how funky this rum got It was dripping with the way too ripe don t eat that banana notes that we ve all come to love Those never really disappeared but they stepped aside to make room for heavy raisin and brown sugar to join in the party Trailing off the rum exits with a purposeful note of golden hay and some vague but very pleasant vanilla You really have to get your nose in the glass to get any of the ethanol burn which is impressive for a piece like this one Tasting She thicc There s a whole lot going on here but the funk isn t as outstanding as the nose might suggest Instead the palate gets hit with some heavy wood and pretty much every baking spice under the sun Front and center are allspice and cinnamon Vanilla sings its song all throughout and in the best way not artificial and not obnoxious Any of the hay that the nose promised seems to disappear but I didn t miss it There s a malty sort of flavor too think Whoppers at the movie theater or wherever Daiquiri This made a solid daiquiri most rums do in my opinion but I d suggest that it doesn t shine in the drink The wood comes through nicely Meanwhile the maltiness seems to bounce off the lime as amicably as it knows how It s not a standard light and crisp daiquiri but it s nice enough to justify throwing it in there I think the rum leans more towards a Tiki context where the spice and malt play well with fruit forward drinks Closing Rating All in all this is a damn fine rum and I shouldn t be surprised given the bar on the label And also given the bar on the label it s no shocker that it does well in tiki drinks Or at least in the Zombies I had it did pretty well Knowing I ll never get my hands on another bottle stings a bit and there s a piece of me that wishes I hadn t killed nearly all of it in one night But sometimes it just be that way It was

Mildew tropical fruits dirt new oak Not bad not great About middle of the road While the tasting notes seem bad its not bad Heavy old book taste TheAgaveFairy Compared to some others in the run that were a similar style at first there almost a light grassy initial smell but then you get that rich vanilla core the really classic profile grows Spices nuts citrus touches of mocha coconut caramel Warm entry super classic event texture is just where it needs to be Tinge of peppermint decent length balanced Not the most exciting but damn solid A very good its just a want a rum pour I wonder if it is DDL or somebody cool like that G List Varnish pine a little creosote on top of rich brown sugar Warm thick sweet Spices sweet and planty like chewing on sugar cane Oak cherry syrup Lots of body and just a hint of grassy funk Cane juice style Whiskey Curator Caramel clove cigars fake banana chocolate stone fruit leather conditioner sweet oak chocolate grapes Overwhelming brown sugar marshmallow pecan pie oven roasted wood chips black pepper earthy funk Dry sweet oak cigar sherry Very sweet nose with an assortment of toasted sweets baked goods with a solid followthrough on the nose Guessing Barbados or Trinidad Pwnedapanda Vanilla and caramel Almost no funk Very sweet nose Bananas Classic nutmeg caramel apples pear guava Some rubber more sweet Pretty bland hints of vanilla Some apple again Banana bread While the finish fell a little flat this was by far my favorite of the whole group I like things to be more on the sweet side vs funky and I found that here along with very rich flavor Rusty Rich Full Candy Syrup Little hot sweet bright good fruit funk medium long warm very good but not special tke Honey molasses ethanol and lime Nice orange note Some tobacco wood shavings Light mango but not impressively fruity Really delicious Medium mouth feel Some heat Molasses oak bourbon vanilla Cinnamon Toffee mango and light papaya Some oak Growing heat Hot hot hot Super bourbon y Reminds me of XXX One and Barbados distillate Oak maple vanilla honey some cherry Would believe it was Stagg Jr on the right day I like this and it s darn good rum but it s not

longer than average Vanilla bean Demerara sugar cocoa nibs maple sugar toasted coconut allspice marshmallows candied orange peel dried apricots sweet basil Sample four is a tad frustrating to me On one hand it features a rich fat satisfying palate and finish reminiscent of some of the better Barbadian rums that I ve sampled On the other the nose is a tad closed off even after the addition of a little water and the entire experience is a couple notches too cloyingly sweet and vanilla y for my tastes I suspect that this pick will appeal more to the hard core Foursquare fans than to a funk

pregame right I m still a rum scrub but I ve sipped enough local faves Doorly s XO Dr Bird Plantation Xaymaca Foursquare Zin Zacapa lol to get a baseline on rum profiles I have a mini each of these picks and I need to find out if I need to buy a bottle or more before they sell out Let s go Hoosiers by Aficionado s XXX Two yr Venezuelan dark rum matured in french oak then finished in ex rum ABV NCF NCA No sugar added Highlights deep oak nose a lovely sweet spicy coating finish pretty easy to sip neat for pf Lowlights slightly sour entry into the palate A Few Tasting Notes oak butterscotch Pours I ve Slightly Preferred to This XXX Three Pours I ve Liked a Little Less Than This Foursquare Zinfandel Finish Two is a tricky beast On a superficial level it smells like an old oaky bourbon like Elijah Craig Barrel Proof EC or Rhetoric but if you hunt you can find some hidden sweet rummy goodness Consumed neat the palate is muddled probably most likely due to the proof This is a bourbon drinker s dream rum Despite my general small complaints this is a no brainer for purchase for the specs price uniqueness value XXX Three Dominican Rep dark rum roughly ish years between years in first fill bourbon steel vatting then years in ex rum ABV NCF NCA No sugar added Highlights Beautiful traditional tropical nose bright and clean on the palate Lowlights it s only higher ABV than the Two but drinks noticeably hotter but again at proof what else am I really supposed to expect here I would ve liked maybe a tad bit more oak but that s personal preference and I m an oakophile A Few Tasting Notes coconut brown sugar Pours I ve Slightly Preferred to This N A Pours I ve Liked a Little Less Than This XXX Two Again I ve had limited exposure and my rum journey is just getting started but I think this is the best rum I ve had so far It s an unsweetened low funk rum with all the dials turned up to It lacks a little complexity towards the finish I think this would be an amazing mixer or a great sip and think Probably would be too dangerous and wasteful to butt chug though an incredible value for an aged cask strength rum I m getting a bottle Or two Or Three plays the Price Is Right Fail trombone sound Final Thoughts Two picks with very different personalities I wouldn t feel great mixing with Two unless you re subbing in rum for bourbon in something like a Rum Old Fashioned that will play well with oak it seems better served as a sipping rum It d be the perfect gateway to from the bourbon world I think Three is much more versatile and vibrant and more representative of the true essence of rum no uncommon maturation casks or finishing added sugar etc I think the Aficionados squad knocked it out of the park on both of these though I d slightly skew towards the Three on days where I m looking for a rum Cheers ,2,Reviews Aficionado s XXX Two and XXX Three SBS  Reviews Aficionado s XXX Two and XXX Three SBS Preface I can wait no longer It s college football Saturday the Hoosiers are inexplicably and I need to pregame right I m still a rum scrub but I ve sipped enough local faves Doorly s XO Dr Bird Plantation Xaymaca Foursquare Zin Zacapa lol to get a baseline on rum profiles I have a mini each of these picks and I need to find out if I need to buy a bottle or more before they sell out Let s go Hoosiers by Aficionado s XXX Two yr Venezuelan dark rum matured in french oak then finished in ex rum ABV NCF NCA No sugar added Highlights deep oak nose a lovely sweet spicy coating finish pretty easy to sip neat for pf Lowlights slightly sour entry into the palate A Few Tasting Notes oak butterscotch Pours I ve Slightly Preferred to This XXX Three Pours I ve Liked a Little Less Than This Foursquare Zinfandel Finish Two is a tricky beast On a superficial level it smells like an old oaky bourbon like Elijah Craig Barrel Proof EC or Rhetoric but if you hunt you can find some hidden sweet rummy goodness Consumed neat the palate is muddled probably most likely due to the proof This is a bourbon drinker s dream rum Despite my general small complaints this is a no brainer for purchase for the specs price uniqueness value XXX Three Dominican Rep dark rum roughly ish years between years in first fill bourbon steel vatting then years in ex rum ABV NCF NCA No sugar added Highlights Beautiful traditional tropical nose bright and clean on the palate Lowlights it s only higher ABV than the Two but drinks noticeably hotter but again at proof what else am I really supposed to expect here I would ve liked maybe a tad bit more oak but that s personal preference and I m an oakophile A Few Tasting Notes coconut brown sugar Pours I ve Slightly Preferred to This N A Pours I ve Liked a Little Less Than This XXX Two Again I ve had limited exposure and my rum journey is just getting started but I think this is the best rum I ve had so far It s an unsweetened low funk rum with all the dials turned up to It lacks a little complexity towards the finish I think this would be an amazing mixer or a great sip and think Probably would be too dangerous and wasteful to butt chug though an incredible value for an aged cask strength rum I m getting a bottle Or two Or Three plays the Price Is Right Fail trombone sound Final Thoughts Two picks with very different personalities I wouldn t feel great mixing with Two unless you re subbing in rum for bourbon in something like a Rum Old Fashioned that will play well with oak it seems better served as a sipping rum It d be the perfect gateway to from the bourbon world I think Three is much more versatile and vibrant and more representative of the true essence of rum no uncommon maturation casks or finishing added sugar etc I think the Aficionados squad knocked it out of the park on both of these though I d slightly skew towards the Three on days where I m looking for a rum Cheers

Foursquare vertical review,I was getting into peated single malt and bourbon when I randomly bought a bottle of foursquare I believe thanks to Ralphy on youtube and it massively turned me onto rum Very much unlike whisky where I even after tasted hundreds cannot really say I would consider myself a fan of a certain distillery or even a single expression although Buffalo Trace and Springbank perform possibly better on aggregate than others I was really converted to a Foursquare fan and bought different bottles of them almost before exploring anything else in the rum world I have to say also what got me into was that you can get some of the best stuff in the world for a bit lower prices than whisky but looking at the prices here I am actually not so sure that is true between you can get most of the very good staples of the whisky world too I am doing this one first because to me it is the baseline If I had to find whisky parallels I would say it is something like a Laphroaig Quarter Cask Macallan or Weller Antique it is balanced and rich yet focused on a particular message it wants to deliver and it does so with little distraction There are no unpleasant notes in here you need to tolerate in order to get the main delivery This message to me is a Christmassy nutmeg clove sugar taste that many friends who tasted this said did not even seem like rum to them I could not plausibly see how anyone who likes whisky would not like this and many friends who said I don t like rum I told you may have never had rum An eye opener for me that made me want to understand the Foursquare range I would say it is exactly like just that the specific clove Christmas taste comes on much earlier it is there on the arrival and less towards the finish I don t knot why but it is a consistent observation It is slightly less sweet and full and round and seductive as the if you put them side by side Actually a bit different the Christmassy flavour is more distributed it seems less one dimensional and more diffuse But not really better I enjoy being hit in the face by the nutmeg cloves I read the has a higher pot still component than the previous years explaining how it is the odd one out out of the It is more complex and less sweet especially if you taste the pure potstill below you can sort of see why All are great good price although maybe some of them seem to get sold out I am not worried about stockpiling I would be excited to buy the new vintage every year of this series These also work with an old fashioned or even in a sour they still carry their big flavour through at this price point also tolerable to not drink neat I have blended a small amount of the together and it was very good too but seemed to converge to be more like the Hereditas Again which the whisky metaphor this feels like a Distiller s Edition or Laphroaig Triple Wood if you feel you understand the straight forward message of the classic the sherry finish takes it up a level it adds a richer yet more confusing undertow and obscures the clear hook But that is a not a bad thing In a direct comparison this sherry syrup makes something like the seem a bit thin It is much more like the in that it does not have a specific moment in which you get the clove Christmas punch in the face I did wonder if you could add some sherry to the and let it sit for a bit and maybe recreate part of this experience So I tried it and while it was delicious it s own way I am glad to say it was not the same at all way more acidic and fresh fruity rather than dark stewed fruits This one is my favourite so far also the one of my guests although I can t really say it is a steal for Might pick up a backup if I am let down a bit by Patrimonio but I am worried Hereditas will sell out before I have a special occasion to open Patrimonio Dominus A lot like the but I would say dryer and more tannic in the finish consistent with the cask I suppose Overall very in the mainstream of Foursquare On paper it looks similar to Plantation XO but put them side by side and see how this outclasses the sweetened Plantation by a mile Habitation Velier to I had to buy this after reading the review of the very influential to me u Tarquin Underspoon There are two key things here this is pot still only while the rest is a blend of column and pot Also it is only aged for years in cognac casks though which are presumably powerful This one is clearly less value for money and more of a risk however I was so curious about what the building blocks are of the standard Foursquare This is basically their single malt equivalent with less wood influence at that Rarely was I as excited to open a bottle It is very different indeed savoury complex reminders of Agricole and Jamaican styles Olives and Banana I have no idea how this even is a component in the series this confusion I felt was actually foreshadowed in the review by Tarquin Underspoon that lead me to buy this I was expecting it to reveal a part of the construction of the blend but it doesn t and it makes me really curious if it was ever possible to try a Foursquare pure column still the Nikka Coffey Malt is a banger so I d say there is nothing wrong with column stills This profits from some water in my opinion But overall I cannot say that it is as delicious and all encompassing as the Hereditas also ff you like this sort of thing something like Hampden Overproof can take you much further in the funky direction possibly too far I am sure the real rum experts who this is targeted at enjoy it a lot but it would not be my first recommendation However after tasting the similarity of all he other Foursquare releases this one can be an absolute joy and refreshing salty and complex and weird Coming back to this after a few months I wonder if this one could end up being my favourite one day though Spiced So this is obviously unsurprisingly different spices half the price ABV I would say it does taste like the if you a add cinnamon b add lots of water c add an unpleasant metallic note So in terms of sipping I would not recommend this however I tried it as an old fashioned or sour and it is great For a Sour maybe on its own for an old fashioned I d make add some Spiced and a little for extra oomph It is interesting that I realize now tasting explicitly flavoured alcohol how interesting and subtle and refined the flavours of rum and whisky are to evoke cinnamon or clove without there being any of these flavours actually added Veritas A mix Foursquare Column and Hampden Pot clear oily fresh and strange Not made for sipping although its interesting to sip this one really holds together and shines in a mixed drink The olive funkiness really goes well together with the acidity and sugar of a cocktail Could be a bit cheaper I suppose for that purpose Velvet Falernum Not bad but I could not quite get it to work yet corn and oil as a cocktail can not live up to the neat class of the pure spirits Finally I have an unopened Premise and am uncertain whether to add Sagacity and Empery as they both have been described as more dry and if I wanted more it honestly would go into the or habitation velier direction I tried two single barrel options at SMWS wanted to buy R but they were out so I took R still unopened Tasted a lot like the Habitation Velier although it s years I wonder if it is full pot still they could not say for sure In conclusion I think maybe level of whisky appreciation is going online and reading reviews and buying well reviewed bottles But that means that for limited releases you are playing catch up and pay the high price after the community has settled on what the winners are And of course many special releases are all snapped up by experts within days of hitting the shelves before any reviews are available So a higher level is clearly to know which producers you trust and buy the new or special releases the moment they become available blind and be the one to review them first I may never get to that point with whisky but with Foursquare I just might I would predict I will keep on buying the exceptional cask series especially the finished ones I have an unopened Patrimonio for a special occasion and a Premise for when I reduced the number of open bottles It is also interesting that Exceptional Cask Series is quite cheap in the UK compared to the Velier FS and Habitation FS releases so that is probably where one should pay attention I am not sure if I will venture as deeply in the Foursquare Velier releases between and I cannot quite see how that could be worth it but I am open to having my mind changed It seems to me the price difference there is not solely driven by fundamentals The bottles do look amazing though It feels good to be a fan of

Tarquin s Unofficial r Rum What Should I Buy Guide,I see a lot of what rum should I buy posts on this sub and pretty much all of the replies involve the same bunch of bottles With that in mind I thought I d write up a quick guide of commonly available bottles that newcomers to rum might be interested in Please keep in mind that this is a list of generally speaking readily available bottles If I included every single one off or rare bottling then this list would be both way longer and almost useless to the budding rum aficionado Also this selection centers around bottles available in the United States so if you re located in Europe or elsewhere then your options may be different and likely far better you lucky so and sos Also on a final note I know that some of my choices and omissions will be controversial but please keep in mind that the following is my personal opinion only I don t and well can t speak for the community at large So here they are in alphabetical order Appleton Year This Jamaican standby is a blend of pot and column distillate with an honest age statement and no added sugar Its profile is very whisky like with a hint of tropical fruit Appleton Signature While not ideal for sipping like the year this Jamaican rum lends itself exceptionally well to cocktails Bacardi Year If all you have available to you is the Bacardis then skip the rest of the range and head straight toward this eight year old Puerto Rican ron It s minimally sugared and makes a decent sipper or mixer Barbancourt If the year bottling is too spendy for your pocketbook this younger bottling is also a tasty sipping rum Barbancourt At fifteen years old this Haitian sipping rum is a fantastic value Expect a refined cognac like profile with some citrusy top notes The Clairins Various ABVs If you re really looking to dive headfirst into the wacky world of white rum then grab one of these Haitian monsters There are three currently available in the American market Sajous Vaval and Le Rocher and they re all worth owning Clement XO ABV ish The aged Clements offer a relatively gentle introduction to rhum agricole or cane juice rum All three expressions are worth grabbing if you re in the market for a more premium bottle for your shelf Damoiseau Pure Cane ABV The Gold Standard of white cane juice rums at least in my book Think fennel bulb cane juice and citrus It makes fantastic cocktails and even sips well if your tastebuds are a little wacky like mine Denizen Merchant s Reserve ABV Originally formulated for Mai Tais this unadulterated blend of Jamaica and Martinique distillate excels as a high end cocktail ingredient Doctor Bird ABV This aged pure pot still Jamaican rum from Worthy Park was finished in moscatel wine casks Expect sweet grapes alongside pungent funk and rotting tropical fruit in a good way Don Q Oak Barrel Spiced Rum ABV Looking for a spiced rum that doesn t taste like artificial cherries or vanilla extract Then look no further than this honestly aged and infused spirit Doorly s ABV This cheap ish aged Foursquare is a favorite daily sipper Partially aged in ex Madeira casks it s mildly sweet and fruity the Glenlivet of rums Total Wine exclusive Dos Maderas ABV If you re a fiend for sherried Scotches then this blend of Barbadian and Guyanan rum should be your first stop The refers to the fact that this blend was aged five years in the tropics in ex bourbon casks then five more years in Spain in PX sherry casks El Dorado ABV Despite its meager age statement the year El Dorado is a budget friendly favorite light on sugar and heavy on the molasses and star anise that we love about Guyanan rums El Dorado ABV Looking for an upgrade from the tasty year Skip the too sweet and go straight for the oaky pot still heavy Expect a more well aged pungent Guyanan experience from this bottle Foursquare ABV Looking to grab a high end high proof bottle These periodic vintage releases from Barbados Foursquare Distillery are our go to recommendation Expect oodles of vanilla bean oak citrus and coconut Foursquare Spiced Rum ABV An honest spiced rum for very little money Yes please If you re not willing to splurge for the Don Q then this should be your house spiced cane spirit Total Wine exclusive Hamilton Demerara Rum ABV If all you re looking for is an El Dorado variant without so much sweetness and you don t want to mess with the scorching proof bottling then this affordable bottling should satisfy that spot on your shelf Hamilton Demerara ABV If you re in the market for a floater for cocktails or fuel for Swizzles skip the Lemon Hart and look for this bottle from rum maestro Ed Hamilton and crew Hamilton Navy Strength ABV A blend of aged rums from Guyana and Jamaica this bottling from Rum Minister Ed Hamilton is great for sipping or sinking into high octane cocktails It s full of caramelized banana molasses and dark fruit Mount Gay Black Barrel ABV If you re craving the whiskey like Barbadian profile on the cheap and don t have a Total Wine nearby then look for this budget friendly bottle Mount Gay XO ABV MGXO as it s affectionately known is one of our basic recommendations for newcomers to rum from the whiskey world It s very whiskey like in profile and additive free so it s a relatively risk free buy for bourbon and Scotch aficionados alike Novo Fogo Barrel Aged Cachaca ABV If you re looking to see what cachaca Brazilian cane juice rum is all about then splurge on this bottle Novo Fogo age their spirit in re charred ex bourbon casks so their aged cachaca caters very much to American tastes while still retaining its character Pampero Aniversario Reserva Exclusiva ABV If you re looking for a significant step up from the likes of Bacardi and Cruzan but don t want to travel too far away in terms of profile then this lightly sugared Venezuelan ron may be to your tastes Plantation Barbados Year ABV This lightly sugared cognac finished riff on the typically unadulterated Barbadian style offers another budget friendly alternative for fans of Mount Gay Black Barrel and Doorly s Plantation Jamaica Vintage Various ABVs The best of the readily available Plantation vintage bottlings in my humble opinion This lightly sugared cognac finished Jamaican rum has been released in various vintages from to and all of them are worth a purchase Plantation OFTD ABV OFTD is a favorite around here for good reason It s a brilliant high octane cocktail incredient and with a little water it makes a fantastic sipper as well Oh and it comes in a hefty L bottle Plantation Stiggins Fancy ABV One of the few fruity rums worth having on your shelf The Stigs is dark rum infused with Victorian pineapples It s surprisingly balanced and not too sweet Plantation Xaymaca ABV This new Jamaican blend from Plantation offers an affordable approachable gateway into the realm of funky Jamaican hooch It s got the tropical fruit that you d expect but it won t kick you in the face with funk Pusser s Gunpowder Proof ABV If you re looking for a funky molassesy Navy style rum but can t find the Hamilton then Pusser s has you covered My advice Skip the wimpy ABV bottling and pay a little extra for this amped up version The Real McCoy ABV If you don t have a Total Wine near you and can t find the Exceptional Casks then this third party bottling is your best bet for that whisky like Foursquare profile Just make sure you re getting the new version and not the old one Rhum J M Blanc ABV If you can t find the Damoiseau Pure Cane or if that bottle isn t to your tastes then try on this unaged Martinique cane juice rum for size It s drier and more herbaceous than the Damoiseau but it takes Ti Punches just as well Rhum J M XO ABV The best readily available high end aged agricole IMO Expect loads of cognac Armagnac like notes alongside that signature J M herbal profile Santa Teresa ABV This Venezuelan blend of pot and column distillate is another good option for a higher end Latin style sipping ron Smith and Cross ABV If you really want to experience Jamaican funk then this lightly aged pure pot still Jamaican beast should be your next stop It s a titan of rotting fruit and funk that will put hair on your chest if you can stand to take a sip Stolen Overproof ABV mL A more refined but still kick in your face punchy alternative to Smith and Cross this six year old sourced Jamaican bottling was supposed to be a limited release but it can still be found everywhere Velho Barreiro Cachaca ABV Looking for a budget friendly cachaca to dump into Caipirinhas This nondescript bottle is my go to

Calories in rum,Hey all This is a question I ve been thinking about for a few weeks now and especially over the last few days when there was a post here about new labeling rules I ve been calorie counting over the last few months in an attempt to finally get down to a healthy weight and something that has helped me a lot is being able to sip a nice rum or whiskey in the evening it s rich very flavorful you can stretch out a session for minutes and it s only about calories for a serving To count calories in spirits I ve been using a table that was posted to r Scotch a while back This is where things get a little interesting or at least as interesting as they can possibly be for a discussion of the nutritional value of an alcoholic beverage that people definitely don t drink for their health I have a bottle of Real McCoy limited edition lying around which happens to have nutrition facts on the back The bottle itself recommends a serving size of mL which it says contains calories HOWEVER this has an ABV of the chart says that mL of ABV Spirit has calories cba to extend that up to mL Point is it s more than I confirmed this with a little bit of math mL of spirit is mL of pure ethanol Ethanol has calories per gram and a density of g mL riveting stuff I know This means that a mL serving of this rum would have calories which evaluates to a little over Obviously there s no way to no for sure without conducting actual experiments which would just be a tremendous waste of delicious rum And it doesn t even really matter we re looking at a difference of about calories or of the calories you would need to eat to gain a pound I just think it s interesting in light of the earlier post even if we start to see actual published nutrition facts I might still be more inclined to trust the table math especially if the calorie count put out by the distillery is a more favorable number This doesn t mean that I m against this quite the opposite in fact More oversight over this is great especially in something like rum that can be very diverse It ll be interesting to get a number on the sugar added to El Dorado and Zacapa I know that there s information on that somewhere and to see how that affects the overall calories Just something to consider ,2,Calories in rum Hey all This is a question I ve been thinking about for a few weeks now and especially over the last few days when there was a post here about new labeling rules I ve been calorie counting over the last few months in an attempt to finally get down to a healthy weight and something that has helped me a lot is being able to sip a nice rum or whiskey in the evening it s rich very flavorful you can stretch out a session for minutes and it s only about calories for a serving To count calories in spirits I ve been using a table that was posted to r Scotch a while back This is where things get a little interesting or at least as interesting as they can possibly be for a discussion of the nutritional value of an alcoholic beverage that people definitely don t drink for their health I have a bottle of Real McCoy limited edition lying around which happens to have nutrition facts on the back The bottle itself recommends a serving size of mL which it says contains calories HOWEVER this has an ABV of the chart says that mL of ABV Spirit has calories cba to extend that up to mL Point is it s more than I confirmed this with a little bit of math mL of spirit is mL of pure ethanol Ethanol has calories per gram and a density of g mL riveting stuff I know This means that a mL serving of this rum would have calories which evaluates to a little over Obviously there s no way to no for sure without conducting actual experiments which would just be a tremendous waste of delicious rum And it doesn t even really matter we re looking at a difference of about calories or of the calories you would need to eat to gain a pound I just think it s interesting in light of the earlier post even if we start to see actual published nutrition facts I might still be more inclined to trust the table math especially if the calorie count put out by the distillery is a more favorable number This doesn t mean that I m against this quite the opposite in fact More oversight over this is great especially in something like rum that can be very diverse It ll be interesting to get a number on the sugar added to El Dorado and Zacapa I know that there s information on that somewhere and to see how that affects the overall calories Just something to consider

Paris Rhumfest a roundup,So this was the fourth one I ve been to from the last five years and the best one yet The move into the larger exhibition space and most importantly away from the glass ceilings made it ever so much more pleasant to move around Around brands from countries made it an incredibly diverse selection and it was good to see the little brands getting just as much attention from the crowds as the big players Among the standouts for me were two Asian stalls Sampan from Vietnam and Helios from Japan Sampan is a very recent startup from a couple of French guys living in Vietnam they imported some ex Armagnac column stills and are making long ferment sophisticated white agricole style rum It comes in three varieties a and an overproof the was just perfect well balanced and full of flavour Helios by contrast is a much older distillery from Okinawa Mostly working with molasses they do a really interesting white from a day open ferment twice through their pot stills blended with product from a batch process hybrid still for volume Branded as Kiyomi it was really tasty On the counter they had a five year old Teeda which was honestly just weird A blend of barrels most of it is aged in barrels previously used for a local spirit called awamori which give a completely different flavour to the rum Can t say I was a fan but glad I tried it Under the counter however they had a yr old Teeda aged exclusively in ex bourbon that was just divine Apparently they have and year expressions available in Japan so this is a company I want to see more of On the French front Trois Rivieres has released a new range aimed squarely at bartenders First up was Origin a slow reduction white which was very clean and tasty with just a hint of the alcohol Next was Double Wood a young m eleve sous bois aged an extra m in new American oak Soft and delicate it stands up well against the younger styles Third was Vieux de la Ocean a yr old which is reduced by distilled seawater from the Diamant area instead of the usual spring source How distillation preserves the salinity is an exercise for the reader Bottled at I found it hot and spicy with a hint of salinity The last though was the most interesting Cannes Brulee Cane sourced from a heavily burned cane field released at this is heavily smoky caramel very like a mescal This is their second batch they made one as an experiment at the end of last year and immediately repeated it in volume at the start of this season La Favorite has released a pair of white monovarietals one Canne Rouge Rivière Belair one Canne Roseau La Digue Both are late harvest with a week open ferment The La Digue at is fresh and clean with a late heat Nice enough Riviere Belair on the other hand is absolutely delicious hotter up front but softer overall A lovely fresh flavour with a sweetness running through it and a very nice lingering taste This is one I want to give to my friends who don t drink agricole I want to give a shoutout to the guys from Cape Verde who have a tiny production of some l per day but make some solid rum great to see some unknown producers getting publicity It was also good to see a solid quartet of Madeira s producers there Engenhos de Calheta Engenho de Norte William Hinton and O Rezinho all had good offerings On the usual suspects front Foursquare had which is a worthy successor to and Empery which is sherry sherry and just a hint of sherry a clear follow up to Premise and the Doorlys which is solid but almost getting too old the woody notes start to dominate the

Rum was invented in part by the Irish A hot take,Right so This is something that has been floating around in my head for a while but I can t get much proof and can t remember how it got there where I read it or what not but here it is My argument is that the Irish invented rum due to the fact that they were indentured servants in British Caribbean colonies While working with the slaves during the sugar refining process they noticed that the locals were drinking the slightly fermented molasses As they were Irish and knew about distillation they thus distilled this mixture in part inventing what today is known as Rum I know this is a long shot but sure look the Irish went everywhere ,2,Rum was invented in part by the Irish A hot take Right so This is something that has been floating around in my head for a while but I can t get much proof and can t remember how it got there where I read it or what not but here it is My argument is that the Irish invented rum due to the fact that they were indentured servants in British Caribbean colonies While working with the slaves during the sugar refining process they noticed that the locals were drinking the slightly fermented molasses As they were Irish and knew about distillation they thus distilled this mixture in part inventing what today is known as Rum I know this is a long shot but sure look the Irish went everywhere

Rum and added sugar which rums that are any good have the least added sugar ,I love perusing well stocked liquor stores and picking up a bottle of something new once or twice a month My favorite being damn near any form of whiskey bourbon scotch Japanese rye yr etc I haven t really met one I hate just ones I like less than others I ve brought home a rum every now and again from but can t get over how sweet they all taste The last couple I got were Zaya and Zacapa Both weren t bad but so very sweet I was thinking about getting another tomorrow and did a quick Google search to find a low sugar one This site shows that most rum on the shelf has an added grams of sugar per liter First of all does this seem accurate It s really disappointing to me that a good liquor can t be made without masking its flavors with a ton of sweetness before bottling After filtering out the high sugar brands I was left with the following list and I was wondering what your take on which I should try and

Watering down overproof rum,Hello I am visiting the US at the moment and am going to buy a few bottles of rum to take back to Europe with me Currently I am planning on buying a bottle of demerara rum and found a bottle of lemon hart on sale I would like to know if it is viable to water down an overproof rum and used it as a regular rum in cocktails In this case lemon hart as a normal demerara rum At the moment I am also going to buy a bottle of Hamilton anyways so another option would be to switch the lemon hart for El Dorado year ,2,Watering down overproof rum Hello I am visiting the US at the moment and am going to buy a few bottles of rum to take back to Europe with me Currently I am planning on buying a bottle of demerara rum and found a bottle of lemon hart on sale I would like to know if it is viable to water down an overproof rum and used it as a regular rum in cocktails In this case lemon hart as a normal demerara rum At the moment I am also going to buy a bottle of Hamilton anyways so another option would be to switch the lemon hart for El Dorado year

Group buy survey Full data,Hi again everyone Finally tabulated all the data from the spreadsheet So starting out here s the data I didn t have counted up for my last post Tasting committee if we are able to do one Thelonecaner won the most nominations Tied after that was texacer tke and TwiddleDD As texacer tke rustypipes and tailgr are all local to eachother they will be involved in the tasting committee as a group giving us a nice set of reviews TwiddleDD rounds out the group with both several nominations and also tastes matching those not covered by the others Honorable mention QuaziMoto also tied everyone else listed for second but unfortunately his tastes are similar to Thelonecaner s so I m skipping him to maintain the diversity of the tasting committee unless we can have a larger committee than I m expecting Brand name examples This was quite interesting To count these I counted all votes for one brand as the same So if you put Foursquare Bourbon Barrel Cask Strength that counted as Foursquare Foursquare votes Plantation votes El Dorado votes Hampden votes Appleton votes Mount Gay votes Smith Cross votes As far as counting only the specific callouts Foursquare won Based on this I feel much more comfortable moving forward with the no or almost no additives vote Even for those of us who favor El Dorado trying something different of good quality will be good for us and the tasting committee is diverse enough to have it covered Origin locations Jamaica votes Barbados votes Guyana votes Martinique votes Information about the additives results price results and other little tidbits is in my previous post In addition the really curious can dig through the raw redacted data here Note I didn t include the nominations as that data would require more cleaning If someone is really curious I can redact clean that data to remove identifying information If I get at least messages from people who previously listed or lower as their maximum price that say they are ok to bump it to we ll set the maximum price at to get a better quality result Otherwise we ll make the maximum price to be more inclusive rather than less Small difference probably but I d rather avoid excluding people if possible This will be the basis of our request then After a few days for comment I ll start following up with suppliers primarily Fine Drams EA Sheer to see what we can make happen This will be a slow process Here s how I m thinking of wording it We re seeking a cask strength rum priced between and per bottle looking to buy about bottles depending where the price comes out We prefer as few additives as possible though small amounts are tolerable Ideally years of aging but anything above years is acceptable Prefer pot still and non chill filtered if possible Favorite

Clement VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux Questions,I ve been diving more into the world of rum lately due to the usual gateway drug of tiki I picked up a bottle of Clement VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux which is my first agricole I ve had outside of a cocktail It s left me a little baffled and I m wondering if others can provide some insight It tastes like cognac with a grassy aftertaste The grassy notes make sense given how agricole is produced and though odd for my palate I actually dig that part However I get zero flavors or aromas that I normally associate with rum rhum It s all cognac and whiskey to me And not even good cognac or whiskey Though I m sure it ll be fine in a cocktail it s got me questioning my bottle purchase So I suppose my question would be is this bottle typical of agricole or is it an outlier If it s an odd duck I d love some recommendations on more typical agricole and agricole vieux ,2,Clement VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux Questions I ve been diving more into the world of rum lately due to the usual gateway drug of tiki I picked up a bottle of Clement VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux which is my first agricole I ve had outside of a cocktail It s left me a little baffled and I m wondering if others can provide some insight It tastes like cognac with a grassy aftertaste The grassy notes make sense given how agricole is produced and though odd for my palate I actually dig that part However I get zero flavors or aromas that I normally associate with rum rhum It s all cognac and whiskey to me And not even good cognac or whiskey Though I m sure it ll be fine in a cocktail it s got me questioning my bottle purchase So I suppose my question would be is this bottle typical of agricole or is it an outlier If it s an odd duck I d love some recommendations on more typical agricole and agricole vieux

Rum r rum labeled Group buy update ,Hi everyone making a new thread to keep organized This was the original At this point it is clear to me that there s enough interest to make this happen if it can So now onto the next steps The logistical difficulties of arranging all this have started to hit me There s no way I can ship these out myself for legal reasons as well as simple logistics I m going to see what who I can find that might be able to help us and could use any help especially if anyone has any connections to make this happen problem Shipping logistics At the rate interest is growing we may well be able to buy an entire barrel about bottles Which is great because it is enough interest that we might convince a distillery to work with us to make this happen But not great for logistics them s a lot of bottles of liquor About of the interest is coming from US based Redditors I ve reached out to the Redditor with FineDrams u ScotchFanatic to see what help they can provide If nothing else they might be able to provide the international shipping logistics maybe for the U S as well with higher shipping costs and a low chance of customs problems I ve also tried emailing liquorama one of the largest US online liquor sellers to see if they might be willing to help with US shipping logistics They re able to ship to all but U S states at US rates state taxes apply If anyone has any connections or otherwise that could help with logistics please contact me or reply here problem Distillery cooperation What Four Roses did with r Bourbon a few years ago was awesome and it seems not something that would happen today through them However I m hopeful that we can find a quality rum distillery that would work with us on this custom order A custom or modified label would be ideal but not required My next plan is to try reaching out to some of the major rum connoisseurs that do reviews and or judge events who seem to be well connected hopefully one of them would both see how cool this would be for us and also be able to put us in touch with the right people to maybe make it happen If that doesn t go anywhere I ll try the rum distilleries directly So that said does anyone have any contacts direct or indirect for a rum distillery that might work with us on this purchase Barring that I m open to suggestions of the distilleries to contact asking El Dorado Diplomatico and Angostura come to mind personally but the more we contact the better our chances of finding one to work with us problem organizing the specifics of the group buy tasting committee if applicable and collecting funds These all seem like easier obstacles that I can work through when we get there So the first step would be to see if I can find a way to accomplish and then I ll resume identifying the specific interest on a person by person basis I ll keep maintaining a list of interested parties for the group buy separately and make a new thread about that when we get to that point So if you want your name added to the list reply directly to me somewhere so I see it but there s no rush as that list won t be finalized for a bit Thanks everyone ,2,Rum r rum labeled Group buy

Bacoo year mini review,Picked up a bottle of Bacoo year at a local liquor shop I think I paid around I took a gamble as there s not much recorded online about this brand This is a Dominican Republic product and according to the website is made from locally grown cane juice not molasses If I had to describe it in a sentence I would say it s a Central American version of Barbancourt It s got that cane juice vegetal stuff going on I hesitate to refer to this as an agricole but in a technical sense I guess it is There is a lot going on in this rum It s on the dry side but sips easily It s got a lot of different flavors going on but lacks any obvious oak flavor I find this refreshing The finish is a little peppery Overall very nice and I think the flavors blend together nicely It s bottled in a lovely bottle with a nice cork and includes a little note explaining the meaning of the Bacoo name Apparently Bacoo is some sort of genie in the bottle type mythological being I think the bottling is a very nice touch in this price range Pays off for them too it practically jumped out at me in the middle of dozens of rums Their website has a statement regarding age Bacoo aged rum provides the consumer with a known quality aged product without deception by providing legitimate age statements When we say and we mean it They could still be lying but it s a good sign that they are up front about their products I only really believe in one scoring system Will I buy this again Absolutely ,2,Bacoo year mini review Picked up a bottle of Bacoo year at a local liquor shop I think I paid around I took a gamble as there s not much recorded online about this brand This is a Dominican Republic product and according to the website is made from locally grown cane juice not molasses If I had to describe it in a sentence I would say it s a Central American version of Barbancourt It s got that cane juice vegetal stuff going on I hesitate to refer to this as an agricole but in a technical sense I guess it is There is a lot going on in this rum It s on the dry side but sips easily It s got a lot of different flavors going on but lacks any obvious oak flavor I find this refreshing The finish is a little peppery Overall very nice and I think the flavors blend together nicely It s bottled in a lovely bottle with a nice cork and includes a little note explaining the meaning of the Bacoo name Apparently Bacoo is some sort of genie in the bottle type mythological being I think the bottling is a very nice touch in this price range Pays off for them too it practically jumped out at me in the middle of dozens of rums Their website has a statement regarding age Bacoo aged rum provides the consumer with a known quality aged product without deception by providing legitimate age statements When we say and we mean it They could still be lying but it s a good sign that they are up front about their products I only really believe in one scoring system Will I buy this again Absolutely

choices won t affect our request anymore though location will still be helpful for shipping and number of bottles desired We also got an offer from a helpful Redditor to design a label for us if such a thing is possible in our group buy I m analyzing the data now A bit tired tonight so I ll have to finish it tomorrow Several categories of the items need to be normalized for spelling wording before I can count them But I thought I d give the quick data now as a teaser and the full data post tomorrow ish We got responses to the survey For the additives acceptable question the answers are split with most favoring no additives said they wanted NO additives don t care and said additives are ok For the that said additives are ok the survey asked them another question with options for As few as possible sugar ok color ok and Other Any ok Of those indicated that they wanted as few additives as possible or rds However I m hesitant to count those percentages exactly as written as there were quite a few people who indicated no or few additives and then went on to list a rum in the what you imagine this tasting like field that I know to have a ton of added sugar Four of the No additives people did that as well as four of the as few as possible group and eight of the don t care group Whatever I find from the data tomorrow we ll be leaning at least towards as few additives as possible

Started a Solera bottle for fun ,I don t know about you but most of my pours are oz straight or various odd amounts for getting my Tiki on This means I often have several bottles that are below full Sometimes not even enough for a oz pour So I got out a tighter sealing decanter with a wide bottom and narrow neck and emptied all my dying soldiers into it Now I have about half a bottle of solera rum that is quite frankly amazing I have seen this done with Bourbon and other brown liquor so I gave it a shot It also reduces surface area that each separate bottle would have and lowers the oxidation rate This way nothing ever goes to waste and I can have a rotating home brand that is always interesting So how about you Do you have a decanter of dregs to sample Questions comments short stories ,2,Started a Solera bottle for fun  I don t know about you but most of my pours are oz straight or various odd amounts for getting my Tiki on This means I often have several bottles that are below full Sometimes not even enough for a oz pour So I got out a tighter sealing decanter with a wide bottom and narrow neck and emptied all my dying soldiers into it Now I have about half a bottle of solera rum that is quite frankly amazing I have seen this done with Bourbon and other brown liquor so I gave it a shot It also reduces surface area that each separate bottle would have and lowers the oxidation rate This way nothing ever goes to waste and I can have a rotating home brand that is always interesting So how about you Do you have a decanter of dregs to sample Questions comments short stories

Help a beginner choose his next rum s from an unfortunately lacking selection ,So basically I am a Rum newbie Wanting to get by cheap I only tried Captain Morgan s white and spiced gold rums Bacardi Oakheart and some super cheap crap thats name I couldn t bother looking out My newest investment was a Plantation Barbados Grande Reserve which I found quite nice both on itself and in the sense that unlike the ones mentioned earlier I didn t instantly feel like spitting it back into the cup and drowning it with Lime and Coke The reason I m looking to expand into similar sipping rums is that even though I really liked a Cuba Libre with both the white and spiced Captain Morgans I have zero interest in keeping my fridge stocked with Coke and Limes and the ungodly amount of ice I was freezing So finally to the reason I m posting here I doubt anybody here is familiar with the clusterfuck of buying alcohol in Finland but TLDR It costs a fortune to buy Ordering from other countries especially outside EU has regulations I have lost track of so I m going to try grab something affordable from Estonia I have been looking at the beginner rum threads and googling around but too often the price range given is very high or the price difference is just huge compared to what its like here Heres a link that lists the rums they re selling at the store im going to I would prefer to stay near the price of the Plantation Barbados Grande Reserve cl in order to bring in more than one or two bottles home but I m open to suggestions There are some glaring omissions like the often mentioned Kraken which I found on the cruise ships selection if anybody wants to take a look at it heres a link but you have to apply the filter yourself I now realise what a huge wall of text this has become and the fact I m basically asking you guys to do my shopping for me but I d greatly appreaciate any recommendations ,2,Help a beginner choose his next rum s from an unfortunately lacking selection  So basically I am a Rum newbie Wanting to get by cheap I only tried Captain Morgan s white and spiced gold rums Bacardi Oakheart and some super cheap crap thats name I couldn t bother looking out My newest investment was a Plantation Barbados Grande Reserve which I found quite nice both on itself and in the sense that unlike the ones mentioned earlier I didn t instantly feel like spitting it back into the cup and drowning it with Lime and Coke The reason I m looking to expand into similar sipping rums is that even though I really liked a Cuba Libre with both the white and spiced Captain Morgans I have zero interest in keeping my fridge stocked with Coke and Limes and the ungodly amount of ice I was freezing So finally to the reason I m posting here I doubt anybody here is familiar with the clusterfuck of buying alcohol in Finland but TLDR It costs a fortune to buy Ordering from other countries especially outside EU has regulations I have lost track of so I m going to try grab something affordable from Estonia I have been looking at the beginner rum threads and googling around but too often the price range given is very high or the price difference is just huge compared to what its like here Heres a link that lists the rums they re selling at the store im going to I would prefer to stay near the price of the Plantation Barbados Grande Reserve cl in order to bring in more than one or two bottles home but I m open to suggestions There are some glaring omissions like the often mentioned Kraken which I found on the cruise ships selection if anybody wants to take a look at it heres a link but you have to apply the filter yourself I now realise what a huge wall of text this has become and the fact I m basically asking you guys to do my shopping for me but I d greatly appreaciate any recommendations

 A word on plates FB post from foursquare,A WORD ON PLATES Plates trays are used in distillation and their function is to enhance the mixing of liquid and vapour While their function is the same in both batch and continuous distillation their purpose is very different I have observed that several people unaware that they have only a rudimentary knowledge of distillation confuse this very important distinction between the use of plates in batch aka pot distillation v continuous aka column distillation I will try to bring a little clarity Basic batch distillation does not employ plates However it is important to understand that the lyne arm is a basic type of plate The cooling of the atmosphere causes liquid i e reflux to form on the sides of the lyne arm and that mixes with the rising vapour The lyne arm then becomes the most vital part of the batch system and its shape affects its function as a plate which directly affects the performance of a still In batch pot distillation the wine is distilled till all the alcoholic spirit is removed in as the name implies a batch process Our lyne arm our plate affects the level of reflux the cooled liquid on the sides which in turn affects two fundamental things the timing of the arrival of the various components of the wine and the contact time with copper The nature of our rum will be decided by the cuts But affecting the timing of the components will affect quality of the cuts In simple terms having a good lyne arm developing good reflux will help ensure ALL of the undesirable heads arrive early and ALL of the undesirable tails arrive late so we can made our ideal cuts Poor reflux poor separation by timing poor quality heart Low contact time with copper poor quality heart When we add plates to a batch pot system we are basically supercharging our lyne arm If we add a condenser we are supercharging our lyne arm even further We are using additional cooling over and above what the atmosphere gives and this together with the additional surface the plates will improve reflux It is the equivalent of using a giant lyne arm The plates don t remove any congeners They don t purify anything They don t make a lighter rum The plates just affect the timing and contact time Our cuts determine the congener profile but the plates by controlling the timing give us far greater control over what we select with our cuts Copper is thought to play a role in ester formation so enhanced time will increase congeners The cuts the copper contact and fermentation determine how heavy we make the rum Not the plates Our double retort still at Foursquare has plates above the pot and a cooling condenser The retorts also function as a kind of plate See the picture Many Caribbean pot stills were modified in the th century to add plates Now in continuous distillation plates likewise enhance liquid vapour contact The same way you have batch distillation without plates you could in theory build a continuous column system without plates But it would be impractically tall The enhanced liquid vapour contact with external condenser cooling make the continuous column system practical And with enough plates and reflux we can separate pure ethanol but we are talking over plates in the last column alone from the other congeners In a steady state continuous column system the plates enhance the physical separation in the column and we draw off heads and tails from physical points where these congeners are concentrated We also draw ethanol or light spirit from the physical point where the ethanol is positioned in the column So the net effect of plates is to assist in purification or making lighter spirits or indeed making pure alcohol So plates have very different roles depending on whether it is continuous or batch distillation The function is the same the role is different And while on the topic there are no hybrid stills Still are either batch or continuous With or without plates Avoid sounding stupid know the difference The post has some nifty photos ,2, A word on plates FB post from foursquare A WORD ON PLATES Plates trays are used in distillation and their function

Rum Classification Better ways than color Why not Region ,I m a bartender and I am trying to research and write up rum classifications for future training However I hate the color system It doesn t do much to explain a rum or even provide a clue as to it s taste along with BS additives etc I learn best by learning how something is made and how those flavors got there However google searches popular blogs and even books all go by color it seems I ve also read the whiskey exchange s blog on the new Gargano system but I m not a fan of that either Although it might be hard why can we not agree to just classify by region like whiskey Islands and the main land regions all tend to do things there own way or in the style of another which could be grouped together E G a funky Jamaican style typically using pot stills or the industrial style cuban Puerto Rico producing light bodied rums If a rum deviates form it s locale s style or for the newer US based rums you could even label it as Cuban style ,2,Rum Classification Better ways than color Why not Region  I m a bartender and I am trying to research and write up rum classifications for future training However I hate the color system It doesn t do much to explain a rum or even provide a clue as to it s taste along with BS additives etc I learn best by learning how something is made and how those flavors got there However google searches popular blogs and even books all go by color it seems I ve also read the whiskey exchange s blog on the new Gargano system but I m not a fan of that either Although it might be hard why can we not agree to just classify by region like whiskey Islands and the main land regions all tend to do things there own way or in the style of another which could be grouped together E G a funky Jamaican style typically using pot stills or the industrial style cuban Puerto Rico producing light bodied rums If a rum deviates form it s locale s style or for the newer US based rums you could even label it as Cuban style

My experience with rum or A beginners brabbling about rum punch ,Note This post has no real point except for asking for opinions about what to try next maybe Anyway here s my story I dislike the taste of alcohol and basically all alcoholic beverages This stuff just stinks and I can t stand it No matter if beer wine or anything I can t drink it It s for this reason that I ve never been drunk until late after my th birthday which means quite something in this day and age Now here in Switzerland we have a drink called Rumpunsch which does not contain alcohol or even real rum It s just a sirup with artificial flavours that get s poured into hot water It s usually sold during the skiing season in the mountain huts And that s a drink I curiously love I love cooking and for that reason I have bottles of liquor at my expense one of them being a strong cheap rum During a new years eve party at a friends home I decided to try and make this Rumpunsch in real So I mixed black tea with lemon and loads of sugar and then poured some rum into it Of course the water was still pretty hot and I didn t dare to put too much rum into it but whatever I created there had a good taste From this moment on I started experimenting around with it Each time I got invited somewhere I decided to bring a bottle of this drink with me which was slightly different from before At the beginning there were giant amounts of sugar inside to suppress the taste of the alcohol but it s a little bit less by now I started experimenting with different teas and ways to sweeten it and then gave it to my friends to try it Half of them stated the it was much to sweet to be drinkable while the other half claimed that it was the best drink with rum that they ever had by now they want me to make it whenever I m invited It also turns out to be quite a dangerous drink as usually the taste of alcohol is really weak while it has the alcohol percentage of wine Great for student parties I ve since started to drink rum pure and it s the only liquor I can drink And while I really enjoy the taste nuances of it I do need about half an hour for a serving of about cl just because of the strong alcohol Oh and I ve also tried basically every cocktail with rum I could find a came to the conclusion that a Mojito is pretty comparable to my drink in sweetness and strength of alcoho but a lot more annoying to prepare So for anybody interested at this point here s my favourite receipes and the question Do these drinks have a name And what should I try next liters of water gr of brown sugar Juice of one large lemon Boil it Turn off stove bags of black tea not necessary but I like it Put them in the hot water and wait until it s gotten to a drinkable temperature dl of dark rum not captain morgan though that s the only thing that managed to ruin this drink Enjoy In my experience it s best not to cool it but to drink it above room temperature Alernatively exchange black tea sugar and lemon through gr of honey So

The Bottle Sugarcane Collection,Hello r rum I got really sick of wine and beer over the last decade they re great just had my fill and I ve moved on to spirits which I enjoy far more This subreddit has been very helpful in allowing me to learn about Rum which I knew nothing about really I ve limited myself to only slots for rum That s all I have space for for now I started with but realized how preposterous that was with the diversity of the booze It s not that I ll never go over but I d like to keep it around there for practicability sakes For reference my collection will include whiskies vodkas gins flavored spirits Agave based drinks brandies and others cordials Amaro and fortified wines Add to those half dozen bitters various mixers and almost every type of sweetener and citrus available My mission is to get sugarcane based liquors that Have the greatest diversity of flavor and style Cover all or most of the styles out there Avoid redundancy Allow for different drinking styles neat cocktails Allow for different budget concerns high end stuff everyday drinkers Present a wide geographic representation Adhere to established classifications Cate mostly Allow me to have the most possible drinks variations Are good So without further ado here are rums that I chose and why YOUNG Cachaça Novo Fogo Unaged or Aged I had a lot of trouble with this category I found it redundant with Blanc Agricole and considered replacing it with unaged Rum like Wray Nephew or Pritchard s Crystal It s really a supply issue here I can t find them very well This one from Total Wine seems fine though and has a pretty good reputation for an imported Cachaca meant for the American market Blanc Agricole Neisson Rhum BA Seems like a standard for the Ti Punch Seems to have the best reputation for Blanc Agricole Column Still Lightly Aged Don Q Cristal Good ol Don Q This is strange rum almost being vodka like I found it fit the style of Spanish Rums well though Clean and light it s been great in mojitos and daiquiris I think I ll stick with it Blended Lightly Aged Plantation Star This rum had such good reviews and reputation it was hard to ignore I was tempted to put Banks or here but I wanted an offering from Plantation It s a great all around mixer Can t believe total wine doesn t have it Sad Pot Still Lightly Aged Smith Cross This was the second Rum I bought I was completely blown away I smelled it and said what the fuck It s powerful and funky This seems like exactly what Jamaican rum should be I use it to punch up cocktails AGED Vieux Agricole Clement VSOP A standard aged Agricola in the traditional fashion Good enough to have neat but OK to mix too I haven t bought this yet but it seems promising Column Still Aged Bacardi As a non rum drinker I still knew Bacardi was shit The only person I know who drinks this swill is my scumbag father in law Not surprised about that However I was surprised by the reviews and price of this offering from Bacardi If it sucks I ll go to Don Q Gran Anejo but I love the value here Pot Still Aged Hamilton St Lucia Pot Still I had the most trouble with this category I also had trouble figuring out who the hell made Hamilton I had to order this online It s on the way The reputation on this was great Blended Bajan Doorly s It was cheap available at Total Wine and comparable to the more expensive Barbadian rums Seems like a great value Haven t tried it yet Blended Sweet Diplomatico Rum Reserva Exclusiva This category is a monster El Dorado Zacapa There are a lot of choices and I can see why I may not hold this one rum above all here and freely admit that I m probably going to switch this around Diplomatico has great reviews and rep It s where people are told to start I get that So I ll have a go at it EXOTIC Pot Still Black well blended pot stills Myers Some of you may cringe at this I certainly did Myers holds a special place in my heart though I had parents that rarely drank But high up in a mysterious cabinet was a bottle of this It was almost solely reserved for pineapple upside down cake It was the first rum I tried Strangely enough my fiancé loves this stuff as she had a similar experience Tastes fine in a DS Adds some color It s not complex but it s cheap and fun If I grow out of this I ll probably try any of the dark rums on the market like Coruba Goslings or Hamilton Navy Blended Black Wood s Navy Another category I had issues with I wasn t even sure this WAS a category A couple of things made me choose this though There was a lot of chatter that it was very authentic for the daily tot which I found kind of historically appealing It was a blend from a couple countries with over proofing Black Overproof Lemon Hart I had read conflicting reports of this It s not available it s available Its changed etc Well I m kind of late to the game but that s OK I flipped a coin between Plantation OFTD and this This won It s really good Adds serious power to some of the tiki drinks I ve made The plantation is probably great too Flavored Plantation Stiggins Pineapple Recommended to me by u GratefulDawg Very cool stuff I liked the idea that flavored rum could be good Flavored liquor gets a bad rap I can see why Yeah I ve puked up Malibu Yeah it s one of my worst memories as a human being This is great though Awesome in a Hawaiian cocktail Spiced Bayou Spiced When discussing rums with my fiancé one of her first questions was What about Captain Morgan The last time I drank Captain Morgan was drinking Tattoo playing triangle bullshit I became intoxicated and remember falling asleep with a particularly disgusting film on the inside of my mouth Everything I had learned up until this point said No fuck that But she made a good point This bar wasn t just for me It was for guests too Some people like Captain Morgan Some people like Kraken That s OK Hell this is the beauty of rum Someone took rum and added spices So what El Dorado and Zacapa dump sugar in there rum What s wrong with spices So I compromised and found this stuff She s from Louisiana and its American made I loved it I made it with red beans and rice AVOIDING Unaged Rums Why no unaged rum Well they just seem kind of redundant I was puzzled by Cate s mention of them They re almost all American made I just can t really find a use for them Long Aged Rums I m simply too much of a novice for this category Maybe after I learn what I really like in a couple of years I ll try one of these But they are simply not worth it right now I can t appreciate them Other Agricoles The main reason I upgraded from to rums was because of Agricole I m still learning about it Perhaps I ll end up liking it better than rum Who knows Of course fucking St George makes one too I m sticking with the basics for now Appleton I looked over my list and there is a glaring omission of Appleton here Some people would probably find that heretical I agree Appleton works as a Blended Aged Appleton Estate works as a Blended Lightly Aged But frankly I found more interesting stuff to put in those spots I m not going to rule it out It s probably great rum It just really didn t fit anywhere to me Zacapa Zaya El Dorado Flor De Cana I found these Rums falling into the Blended Aged Sweet category which was pretty massive Again I think I ll rotate them around to find which one I like A lot of you would argue that I should throw out other categories for more of these That makes sense but I want the variety in lightly aged and black rums I ll try these someday after I polish off the bottle of Diplomatico Any comments or critiques please What am I missing Is there redundancy What should I add if I went to bottles ,2,The Bottle Sugarcane Collection Hello r rum I got really sick of wine and beer over the last decade they re great just had my fill and I ve moved on to spirits which I enjoy far more This subreddit has been very helpful in allowing me to learn about Rum which I knew nothing about really I ve limited myself to only slots for rum That s all I have space for for now I started with but realized how preposterous that was with the diversity of the booze It s not that I ll never go over but I d like to keep it around there for practicability sakes For reference my collection will include whiskies vodkas gins flavored spirits Agave based drinks brandies and others cordials Amaro and fortified wines Add to those half dozen bitters various mixers and almost every type of sweetener and citrus available My mission is to get sugarcane based liquors that Have the greatest diversity of flavor and style Cover all or most of the styles out there Avoid redundancy Allow for different drinking styles neat cocktails Allow for different budget concerns high end stuff everyday drinkers Present a wide geographic representation Adhere to established classifications Cate mostly Allow me to have the most possible drinks variations Are good So without further ado here are rums that I chose and why YOUNG Cachaça Novo Fogo Unaged or Aged I had a lot of trouble with this category I found it redundant with Blanc Agricole and considered replacing it with unaged Rum like Wray Nephew or Pritchard s Crystal It s really a supply issue here I can t find them very well This one from Total Wine seems fine though and has a pretty good reputation for an imported Cachaca meant for the American market Blanc Agricole Neisson Rhum BA Seems like a standard for the Ti Punch Seems to have the best reputation for Blanc Agricole Column Still Lightly Aged Don Q Cristal Good ol Don Q This is strange rum almost being vodka like I found it fit the style of Spanish Rums well though Clean and light it s been great in mojitos and daiquiris I think I ll stick with it Blended Lightly Aged Plantation Star This rum had such good reviews and reputation it was hard to ignore I was tempted to put Banks or here but I wanted an offering from Plantation It s a great all around mixer Can t believe total wine doesn t have it Sad Pot Still Lightly Aged Smith Cross This was the second Rum I bought I was completely blown away I smelled it and said what the fuck It s powerful and funky This seems like exactly what Jamaican rum should be I use it to punch up cocktails AGED Vieux Agricole Clement VSOP A standard aged Agricola in the traditional fashion Good enough to have neat but OK to mix too I haven t bought this yet but it seems promising Column Still Aged Bacardi As a non rum drinker I still knew Bacardi was shit The only person I know who drinks this swill is my scumbag father in law Not surprised about that However I was surprised by the reviews and price of this offering from Bacardi If it sucks I ll go to Don Q Gran Anejo but I love the value here Pot Still Aged Hamilton St Lucia Pot Still I had the most trouble with this category I also had trouble figuring out who the hell made Hamilton I had to order this online It s on the way The reputation on this was great Blended Bajan Doorly s It was cheap available at Total Wine and comparable to the more expensive Barbadian rums Seems like a great value Haven t tried it yet Blended Sweet Diplomatico Rum Reserva Exclusiva This category is a monster El Dorado Zacapa There are a lot of choices and I can see why I may not hold this one rum above all here and freely admit that I m probably going to switch this around Diplomatico has great reviews and rep It s where people are told to start I get that So I ll have a go at it EXOTIC Pot Still Black well blended pot stills Myers Some of you may cringe at this I certainly did Myers holds a special place in my heart though I had parents that rarely drank But high up in a mysterious cabinet was a bottle of this It was almost solely reserved for pineapple upside down cake It was the first rum I tried Strangely enough my fiancé loves this stuff as she had a similar experience Tastes fine in a DS Adds some color It s not complex but it s cheap and fun If I grow out of this I ll probably try any of the dark rums on the market like Coruba Goslings or Hamilton Navy Blended Black Wood s Navy Another category I had issues with I wasn t even sure this WAS a category A couple of things made me choose this though There was a lot of chatter that it was very authentic for the daily tot which I found kind of historically appealing It was a blend from a couple countries with over proofing Black Overproof Lemon Hart I had read conflicting reports of this It s not available it s available Its changed etc Well I m kind of late to the game but that s OK I flipped a coin between Plantation OFTD and this This won It s really good Adds serious power to some of the tiki drinks I ve made The plantation is probably great too Flavored Plantation Stiggins Pineapple Recommended to me by u GratefulDawg Very cool stuff I liked the idea that flavored rum could be good Flavored liquor gets a bad rap I can see why Yeah I ve puked up Malibu Yeah it s one of my worst memories as a human being This is great though Awesome in a Hawaiian cocktail Spiced Bayou Spiced When discussing rums with my fiancé one of her first questions was What about Captain Morgan The last time I drank Captain Morgan was drinking Tattoo playing triangle bullshit I became intoxicated and remember falling asleep with a particularly disgusting film on the inside of my mouth Everything I had learned up until this point said No fuck that But she made a good point This bar wasn t just for me It was for guests too Some people like Captain Morgan Some people like Kraken That s OK Hell this is the beauty of rum Someone took rum and added spices So what El Dorado and Zacapa dump sugar in there rum What s wrong with spices So I compromised and found this stuff She s from Louisiana and its American made I loved it I made it with red beans and rice AVOIDING Unaged Rums Why no unaged rum Well they just seem kind of redundant I was puzzled by Cate s mention of them They re almost all American made I just can t really find a use for them Long Aged Rums I m simply too much of a novice for this category Maybe after I learn what I really like in a couple of years I ll try one of these But they are simply not worth it right now I can t appreciate them Other Agricoles The main reason I upgraded from to rums was because of Agricole I m still learning about it Perhaps I ll end up liking it better than rum Who knows Of course fucking St George makes one too I m sticking with the basics for now Appleton I looked over my list and there is a glaring omission of Appleton here Some people would probably find that heretical I agree Appleton works as a Blended Aged Appleton Estate works as a Blended Lightly Aged But frankly I found more interesting stuff to put

 Real Rum vs Sugar Added Rum Where do you draw the line ,I love rum For the purposes of this thread I am only looking at aged golden dark rum What I am wondering is are you really a true fan of rum if all you like is super sugary rums I m talking reserva exclusiva el dorado zaya Those things have so much sugar in them and so much flavor added that they blur the gap between rum and spiced rum Don t get me wrong I enjoy some spiced rums And I love El Dorado and Zaya and I haven t tried any diplomatico rums yet But I see many rum collectors aficionados who swear by almost exclusively the sugary stuff It s smoother they say I ll tell you if I took my Mount Gay XO and dumped g L of sugar into it it would damn well taste smoother too Although that would throw the flavour profile off most likely To me a sugary rum is interesting but feels like a cheat When I try Zaya or El Dorado I feel like I m drinking rum and spiced rum Something that sits in the middle When I drink Mount Gay XO or Flor De Cana Year I feel like all the flavours I m getting are legitimate rum flavours no trickery no spiced gimmicks every bit of the experience relies on masterful techniques that require sugar practically in the bottle When I hear someone say something like I love rum but I can t stand dry rum dry rum and dry rum But I love sugary rum sugary rum sugary rum well I cringe a bit And I see it a lot here Someone asks for a smooth rum and they are met with try this sugary one rather than a suggestion of a smooth rum that is smooth because of the actual ageing process Flor De Cana is an EXCELLENT example of smooth In the end spiced rum proper dry rum rum that sits between dry and sugary and sugary rum all of those can be excellent I love collecting and trying it all less so spiced rums but every once in a while But to see a rum focused reddit section with so much heavy focus on sugary rums I don t know I had to make a post about that On a side note Every time I mention mixing a really nice rum in coke about to ratio I am met with a lot of negativity Yet the same people love their sugared rums I don t get it They say you can t taste an expensive rum in coke I say if you can t tell the difference in the quality of a rum through your coke you must be drinking a ratio or you really don t know your rum and yes some great rums don t do well in coke But I don t get how people will say THIS RUM IS AMAZING so much sugar in it and Never mix it with coke that s a waste Blah Bugs me By one definition of sugary rum with added flavors then rum bitters water sugar rum It s not a mixed

Ryoma Japanese rum,Recently a bottle wandered into my stock and I cannot but recommend the stuff I must warn you that if you are accustomed to the classical heavily sweetened colored vanilla bombs like Zacapa or Diplomatico this one will probably surprise you Exceptionally light crisp of really pale yellow color which many rums naturally have until they are colored with caramel vegetal and slightly sweet on the nose with delicate complex and nuanced tones on only slightly sweet background It s produced by fermentation of fresh sugar cane juice similar to agricole rums and it shares some common traits Thumbs up great stuff for anyone who does not mind expanding his her rum horizons ,2,Ryoma Japanese rum Recently a bottle wandered into my stock and I cannot but recommend the stuff I must warn you that if you are accustomed to the classical heavily sweetened colored vanilla bombs like Zacapa or Diplomatico this one will probably surprise you Exceptionally light crisp of really pale yellow color which many rums naturally have until they are colored with caramel vegetal and slightly sweet on the nose with delicate complex and nuanced tones on only slightly sweet background It s produced by fermentation of fresh sugar cane juice similar to agricole rums and it shares some common traits Thumbs up great stuff for anyone who does not mind expanding his her rum horizons

My quest for a mid range sipping rum update , Last month I posted here to ask for advice on sipping rums that don t break the bank I really appreciated the discussion it brought about so I wanted to share my experience so far When I visited Kansas City for Thanksgiving I was able to pick up a bottle of Plantation year I haven t found the Plantation brand anywhere in my home state of Indiana so this was quite a treat At for a ml the Plantation year is the best sipping rum I have ever tasted This was both a delicious rum and an amazing deal so I m really excited to try the higher quality rums from Plantation It s a damn shame the brand is apparently not available in my home state I ve almost finished this bottle and I m savoring what little is left The other rum I picked up in Kansas City was Pusser s blue label This rum is available in Indiana for but it was cheaper in KC so I jumped on the deal The funkiness of the rum was hard to get used to especially when sipping However I grew to love Pusser s as my go to for a rum and coke Milder rums get overtaken by the sweetness of Coca Cola but Pusser s funkiness stands up incredibly well to it As you can see from the photo I ve completely killed off this bottle but I think it ll become a regular in my bar because it makes an absolutely delightful rum and coke I don t know if I m ready to sip Pusser s yet but I may end up working my way to that A common suggestion in my last thread was that Smith Cross was the next level of funkiness after Pusser s Hopefully I ll get a chance to try it soon I doubt I ll enjoy it as a sipper right now but I bet it ll make a mean rum and coke Lately I ve been planning on picking up a bottle of Mt Gay Eclipse in the hopes of finding something comparable to Plantation year Eclipse is here and it s made in Barbados just like Plantation so I m anxious to try it However when I went to get the Mt Gay I saw that Bacardi was on sale It s usually here but was marked down to so I took the chance to try it out If Bacardi is truly aged a full years then it is the oldest rum I have tried so far This is also apparent in the darkness and complexity of the rum The plum flavor is oddly dominant but not necessarily in a bad way The rum feels heavy compared to say Plantation I m not sure I like it but I m keeping an open mind It makes a pretty good daiquiri I m still working on drinking it straight As of tonight I unequivocally prefer Plantation especially considering its price in comparison to Bacardi Maybe after a couple more nights with Bacardi I ll learn to better appreciate its complexities I ll have a better idea once I get a chance to try some of Plantation s older offerings but who knows when that will be I don t know how similar Mt Gay Eclipse will be to Plantation but it ll probably be the next rum I try At if Eclipse is anything like Plantation it ll definitely be my go to Has anyone had experience with any of these rums I d love to hear your

cocktails to convert this rum skeptic,Okay okay so I m not exactly skeptical of rum as a beverage I enjoy a Daiquiri and a Cube Libre and it s certainly my wife s favorite spirit But these days I m trying out a lot of short cocktail recipes and struggling to include rum in my repertoire The problem is probably the sweetness I m VERY sensitive to it For example I bought a bottle of El Dorado and I m not disliking it but I m struggling to find the magic in my cocktails To be fair it s okay in a Manhattan and a bit better in a simple Old Fashioned but I usually prefer rye whiskeys there I feel like I don t have much reason to move beyond an inexpensive white rum like Flor de Cana Year Extra Seco My other problem is that many cocktails with dark aged rum are tiki style drinks many of them are simply too sweet for me and many are simply more work than I m normally willing to spend after a long day at work and putting toddlers to bed So in short drier rums Different cocktails Or just stick to taller and more easy going rum drinks ,2,cocktails to convert this rum skeptic Okay okay so I m not exactly skeptical of rum as a beverage I enjoy a Daiquiri and a Cube Libre and it s certainly my wife s favorite spirit But these days I m trying out a lot of short cocktail recipes and struggling to include rum in my repertoire The problem is probably the sweetness I m VERY sensitive to it For example I bought a bottle of El Dorado and I m not disliking it but I m struggling to find the magic in my cocktails To be fair it s okay in a Manhattan and a bit better in a simple Old Fashioned but I usually prefer rye whiskeys there I feel like I don t have much reason to move beyond an inexpensive white rum like Flor de Cana Year Extra Seco My other problem is that many cocktails with dark aged rum are tiki style drinks many of them are simply too sweet for me and many are simply more work than I m normally willing to spend after a long day at work and putting toddlers to bed So in short drier rums Different cocktails Or just stick to taller and more easy going rum drinks

Finally had my breakthrough moment ,So I love drinking but I hate the taste burn of alcohol and try as I might I couldn t find anything hard that I actually liked whiskey and rum all tasted the same to me whether it was Jameson or Caribbean dark rum literally rum or cheap crap my mom used for cooking it all tasted the exact same gross and just burny I never understood how people get all those flavor notes and stuff Well I finally got around to trying Captain Morgan and while it still burned a bit more than I like I can definitively say that the aftertaste at least was good mainly butterscotch caramel So yeah it was pretty cool finally realizing what flavor notes actually are What other preferably not too expensive brands of rum can you all recommend ,2,Finally had my breakthrough moment  So I love drinking but I hate the taste burn of alcohol and try as I might I couldn t find anything hard that I actually liked whiskey and rum all tasted the same to me whether it was Jameson or Caribbean dark rum literally rum or cheap crap my mom used for cooking it all tasted the exact same gross and just burny I never understood how people get all those flavor notes and stuff Well I finally got around to trying Captain Morgan and while it still burned a bit more than I like I can definitively say that the aftertaste at least was good mainly butterscotch caramel So yeah it was pretty cool finally realizing what flavor notes actually are What other preferably not too expensive brands of rum can you all recommend

Upcoming goodies from the TTB,Hunter Laing is a whisky independent bottler from the UK that has recently branched out into rum with a range of single cask continental aged rums which up until now could only be found in Europe But last week COLAs were approved for Jamaicans a Hampden Monymusk and Worthy Park though the images mistakenly show Hampden under the brand name Golden Devil imported by DJK Imports who are responsible for a number of Hunter Laing s whisky releases in the US Why the name change you ask Because there is already a Kill Devil Rum trademarked in the US by Outer Banks Distilling of North Carolina The Monymusk is a year old distilled in March which has yet to be released in the UK The Hampden is a year old distilled in April evidently the same stock as has already been released at cask strength in the UK Both will be bottled at a healthy ABV No information available on the Worthy Park thanks to the wrong labels being submitted No word on prices either but I d guess fairly steep particularly for the Hampden There is also a major caveat that we can t predict how widely available these inherently limited releases will be A COLA could be submitted for anything from a nationwide retail release to a highly limited import available only in select bars and is also no guarantee the rum will ever actually be released in the US St Lucia Distillers are also coming out with the th edition of their series according to the label it s being bottled this Monday at ABV That s higher than prior editions which have been pretty readily available across the country in the range so I d expect this edition to be similar if a little pricier Fans of Colombian rum will also note that La Hechicera is coming to the US If it s marketed anything like it is in Europe I assume this one will have decent availability and sell in the range Barbancourt have submitted a label for their limited edition Cuvee ans which was originally released at ABV in as a th anniversary release Who knows what their intentions are but this edition is ABV and again comes packaged in a special crystal decanter so whatever the availability it would probably cost as much as the original which was a couple hundred Closer to home Breckenridge out of Colorado are coming out with a ABV white rum to join their spiced rum ,2,Upcoming goodies from the TTB Hunter Laing is a whisky independent bottler from the UK that has recently branched out into rum with a range of single cask continental aged rums which up until now could only be found in Europe But last week COLAs were approved for Jamaicans a Hampden Monymusk and Worthy Park though the images mistakenly show Hampden under the brand name Golden Devil imported by DJK Imports who are responsible for a number of Hunter Laing s whisky releases in the US Why the name change you ask Because there is already a Kill Devil Rum trademarked in the US by Outer Banks Distilling of North Carolina The Monymusk is a year old distilled in March which has yet to be released in the UK The Hampden is a year old distilled in April evidently the same stock as has already been released at cask strength in the UK Both will be bottled at a healthy ABV No information available on the Worthy Park thanks to the wrong labels being submitted No word on prices either but I d guess fairly steep particularly for the Hampden There is also a major caveat that we can t predict how widely available these inherently limited releases will be A COLA could be submitted for anything from a nationwide retail release to a highly limited import available only in select bars and is also no guarantee the rum will ever actually be released in the US St Lucia Distillers are also coming out with the th edition of their series according to the label it s being bottled this Monday at ABV That s higher than prior editions which have been pretty readily available across the country in the range so I d expect this edition to be similar if a little pricier Fans of Colombian rum will also note that La Hechicera is coming to the US If it s marketed anything like it is in Europe I assume this one will have decent availability and sell in the range Barbancourt have submitted a label for their limited edition Cuvee ans which was originally released at ABV in as a th anniversary release Who knows what their intentions are but this edition is ABV and again comes packaged in a special crystal decanter so whatever the availability it would probably cost as much as the original which was a couple hundred Closer to home Breckenridge out of Colorado are coming out with a ABV white rum to join their spiced rum

Saint James Royal Amber, From the town of Saint Marie since in Martinique Saint James Royal Amber Rum is one of the rare agricoles that have been made available in Ontario Rum agricole is produced using pure fresh cane juice which is fermented into a distillers wine before being distilled through a continuous column still Saint James Royal Amber Rum has achieved the AOC markings for a Martinique rum This means that all sugar cane is produced ground and pressed on island no additional syrup or molasses is allowed The final product must contain a minimal amount of added sugar This particular product is aged for to months making it a younger rum Appearance A fairly plain bottle design is improved by the custom markings protruding from the glass The screw top is still a cheap presentation but appropriate for the price bracket of this product Once in the glass it is a slightly above pale amber Nose This rum solidified in my mind the reasons for multiple tasting sessions before creating these reviews On first go around Saint James Royal Amber Rum came off very pungent with a solvent dominating the flavour profile On subsequent tastings while it was still present it was no longer the dominant profile Sweet orange peel shows its face as the first whiff you get from the glass As you dig deeper you find sour grapes and a diverse vegetal flavour that could best be described as decomposing wet leaves Throughout a hint of nail polish remover stays with you leaving the experience wanting Flavour The nose may have reduced the solvent scent that was present on subsequent tastings but on the palate it stayed strong and prominent Unlike Armagnac this harshness doesn t seem to be used to expand the flavour profile rather I personally found it to be nothing but distracting Attempting to put that behind me I found hints of grass raw adult spinach and oak A strong spice of black pepper and jalapenos closes this one out as the most dominant flavour outside the solvents Finish A very long finish This one will stay with you for some time It is a very plain fading spice that slowly morphs into a soft vegetal flavour stuck to your tongue As you can probably tell from above this is not to my taste I am not a huge fan of the powerful spices or astringent scents flavours that seem to permeate throughout this spirit I can see a lot of potential in this despite its in my personal opinion flaws I am very interested in finding the older members of the line up which are aged and years respectively Total Variations I added two small ice cubes and found that the nose essentially disappeared It became faint but the dominant scents remained only losing out on the already weak scents The palate on the other hand lost one of its largest defining features the spice is completely gone This left the drink with very little to compete with the solvent causing it to be nigh undrinkable A few more pictures available on the actual blog post ,2,Saint James

What Makes A Rum For Sipping Or For Mixing,Spawned by a discussion on my last post post here Excluding spiced rums for obvious reasons How would you define one rum for sipping vs another for mixing Would you rate a top tier mixing rum on the same scale as a sipping rum Is a cheaper rum in your opinion automatically for mixing And lastly one that I hadn t ever really thought about before Do you have any white rums that you would consider a sipping rum Personally I would rate it all as a sliding scale I think I am more in line with u thelonecaner here where I would say that rums generally do not fall into a clear cut designation I would say I place a rum into my mixing category when it has good bones but has flaws that need to be covered up or flavours that work best when accentuated The reasoning above is why I would give all cheaper priced rums a chance at least as a sipping rum Price doesn t immediately dictate quality Until recently I hadn t found a white rum I would truly call a sipping rum Yongehurst Harbour Rum which i tried recently is the first I have tried that was good enough on it s own to sip ,2,What Makes A Rum For Sipping Or For Mixing Spawned by a discussion on my last post post here Excluding spiced rums for obvious reasons How would you define one rum for sipping vs another for mixing Would you rate a top tier mixing rum on the same scale as a sipping rum Is a cheaper rum in your opinion automatically for mixing And lastly one that I hadn t ever really thought about before Do you have any white rums that you would consider a sipping rum Personally I would rate it all as a sliding scale I think I am more in line with u thelonecaner here where I would say that rums generally do not fall into a clear cut designation I would say I place a rum into my mixing category when it has good bones but has flaws that need to be covered up or flavours that work best when accentuated The reasoning above is why I would give all cheaper priced rums a chance at least as a sipping rum Price doesn t immediately dictate quality Until recently I hadn t found a white rum I would truly call a sipping rum Yongehurst Harbour Rum which i tried recently is the first I have tried that was good enough on it s own to sip

El Dorado th Anniversary Tasting Dinner,Hey Everyone a few friends and I have started a little reviewing blog and the first series I just finished putting online Below is my write up of the El Dorado th Anniversary launch dinner and tasting in Toronto Links on the names go to full write ups on each spirit but the article contains my general opinions Feedback is greatly appreciated On May th Vintages hosted their first Rum tasting dinner It was an expensive evening at per ticket but I think as you read on I think you can see it was worth it The evening started with Cocktails at in the top floor lounge of the National Club in Toronto and moved onto a structured tasting at followed by a five course dinner in the impressive dining hall The rums we were sampling throughout the night progressed through some of the best El Dorado has to offer El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Old Red Wine Cask El Dorado Year Old Dry Madeira Wine Cask Single Barrel ICBU Single Barrel EHP El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Ole Distillation El Dorado th Anniversary In the lounge we started with cocktails and appetizers A choice of two cocktails was given a variation of the Dark and Stormy featuring El Dorado Year Old mixed with Ginger Beer and Mango Orange juice the second choice was a rum punch made with El Dorado Year Old Both were overly sweet and at mere half ounce pour the rum taste was nonexistent For a drink focused evening that was a poor introduction however the atmosphere and a setup was amazing It was on average a much older crowd at that ticket price no surprise there and nearly all were well dressed I looked like a common peasant in my shirt and tie At about the lights were dimmed and everyone was ushered into the main dining room two level room adorned with paintings of past Canadian Prime ministers When I had arrived I was given a table assignment which turned out to be great I was seated directly next to the podium and close to where the products were on display My table of ten fortunately was spectacular outside one person I had arranged to meet there I knew no one going into this event My tablemates all ended up being on the younger side and all were major rum enthusiasts The event organizers were quick to get a representative from Vintages up to the podium and get the night rolling Our main speaker for the night was Shaun Caleb the Master Distiller at El Dorado Shaun Caleb Shaun s passion for what he has accomplished and how he hopes to steer El Dorado s products was palpable The event was oversold with guests listening to Shaun describe the nose and palate of the first three rums He would run into the occasional short tangent about the sourcing of the barrels or the history of the stills which made it all the more captivating I could have listened all evening but the kitchen was ready to serve Note For full reviews please click on the title of each rum below El Dorado Hands down one of the best values in premium rums on the market Coming in at a reasonable brace yourselves Americans CAD this product is mid priced but easily outperforms many rums at much higher levels The smooth alcohol is flavoured with citrus spice banana and caramel IT has a very sweet bouquet and palate which is probably caused by this rum having quite a bit of added sugar El Dorado Red Wine Cask This is the yo rum aged an additional months in a char level cask that had been previously used for a Portuguese red wine It is quite amazing how much this affects the flavor profile of the product The citrus and especially the orange come through on the nose much more predominantly while it dries out the actual drink much like a full bodied red wine I enjoy some sweet rums and do not mind when sugar is added as one can tell by me liking El Dorado but this one comes to an anticlimactic ending with an overly sweet finish that was overpowering even for a sweet tooth like me El Dorado Dry Madeira Cask Again aged an additional months this time in a fortified Madeira Wine Cask The nose on this product was rather toned down compared to the previous rum Dried fruit and oak were predominant A very dry alcohol which had flavors of banana chips and pepper When I went back to the Red Wine version afterwards it made it taste almost unbearably sweet I enjoyed this one so much I bought a bottle for CAD First Dinner was an amazing five courses designed to pair with a corresponding rum from El Dorado We started with a roasted sweet potato bisque with a spiced granny smith apple brunoise and cinnamon oil drizzle I can t lie I only took a sip of the rum while eating because I was more interested in understanding the rum on its own then with food I took to sipping my rums after each course was finished for the rest of the night Single Barrel ICBU Distilled on a still originating in the ICBU single barrel rum has a sweet sugar cane note featuring hints of oak caramel raisins and tropical fruits A sipping rum of high quality it goes down smooth with very little burn The palate of the rum featured oak coconut oranges tobacco and spice The second course was a Panko crusted crab cake on a grilled pineapple salsa and mini salad This was paired with the EHP Single Barrel The pineapple tied in well with the tropical fruit flavors of the rum but once again I mostly skipped pairing it with the food Single Barrel EHP Another from the single barrel or connoisseur line as El Dorado Likes to call it this rum aged for years but no age statement on the bottle The light aroma starred apple and orange as the prominent scents On the palate it came with the pear cinnamon oak and a light undertone of caramel I actually thought this would have gone better with the first course but hey I am not a chef Main course was the best beef tenderloin I have had in my life It was served on buttermilk mashed potato sautéed heirloom carrots and covered in a cabernet demi glace The meat was so tender and cooked to perfection it essentially melted in your mouth This was paired with the excellent Year Old Special Reserve El Dorado Special Reserve My go to sipping rum at home and one of the only ones I had enjoyed in reasonable amounts before this event Caramel raisin orange peel and almonds all make their appearance in the nose of this rum The alcohol in this rum by far the warmest of the evening and you can really feel its presence on the way down The palate is treated to an array of flavours including oak a strong caramel raisins prunes and other dry fruits The assorted cheese plate starred three cheeses Roquefort Carles Avonlea Clothbound Cheddar and Lindenhof Raw Milk Gouda It also came with assorted breads and small amounts of honey and balsamic reduction Paired with the flagship year old Demerara Rum This was the first course that I think I really understood the pairing The soft and bitter flavours with the cheese mixed with the sweetness of the honey and balsamic brought out some of the better characteristics of the rum El Dorado Year Old Demerara Rum This is from the distillation which I had not yet tried my bottle at home being from the run The nose is very sweet with candied orange toffee honey and almond It goes down very smooth and tastes of banana honey almonds caramel and oak Desert Desert was an obvious move to really showcase what El Dorado believes to be the main characteristics of the star pairing of the evening El Dorado th anniversary It was a sticky toffee pudding with a nest of honey sticks resting on it a flambéed banana slice a caramel chip with banana sorbet and exactly three raspberries The raspberries must have just been there for colour but the rest was bang on for flavours in the rum This dessert was an amazing ending to an amazing night El Dorado th Anniversary From a combination of distillates ranging in years of age I was expecting a much stronger scent especially for one aged in such a hot climate The nose hints at banana honey fig marzipan and a sweet charred oak Smoother than I thought could be possible for a well aged rum although it is slightly sour on the tongue The nose gave away most of it secrets banana honey fig marzipan all make an appearance Caramel and fruits round out the tastes The evening wrapped up with the pitch to buy some bottles I personally bought the EHP ICBU and Year Old Madeira Wine Cask bottles I would have loved to buy a th anniversary but unfortunately at a bottle it was a touch outside my price range For the first ever rum tasting hosted by Vintages I have to say it was amazing The night was well worth it excellent speakers excellent products and excellent company If we can expect this quality from their spirit events I will certainly be attending what they have to offer in the future Link to this Post Imgur Album of all photos ,2,El Dorado th Anniversary Tasting Dinner Hey Everyone a few friends and I have started a little reviewing blog and the first series I just finished putting online Below is my write up of the El Dorado th Anniversary launch dinner and tasting in Toronto Links on the names go to full write ups on each spirit but the article contains my general opinions Feedback is greatly appreciated On May th Vintages hosted their first Rum tasting dinner It was an expensive evening at per ticket but I think as you read on I think you can see it was worth it The evening started with Cocktails at in the top floor lounge of the National Club in Toronto and moved onto a structured tasting at followed by a five course dinner in the impressive dining hall The rums we were sampling throughout the night progressed through some of the best El Dorado has to offer El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Old Red Wine Cask El Dorado Year Old Dry Madeira Wine Cask Single Barrel ICBU Single Barrel EHP El Dorado Year Old El Dorado Year Ole Distillation El Dorado th Anniversary In the lounge we started with cocktails and appetizers A choice of two cocktails was given a variation of the Dark and Stormy featuring El Dorado Year Old mixed with Ginger Beer and Mango Orange juice the second choice was a rum punch made with El Dorado Year Old Both were overly sweet and at mere half ounce pour the rum taste was nonexistent For a drink focused evening that was a poor introduction however the atmosphere and a setup was amazing It was on average a much older crowd at that ticket price no surprise there and nearly all were well dressed I looked like a common peasant in my shirt and tie At about the lights were dimmed and everyone was ushered into the main dining room two level room adorned with paintings of past Canadian Prime ministers When I had arrived I was given a table assignment which turned out to be great I was seated directly next to the podium and close to where the products were on display My table of ten fortunately was spectacular outside one person I had arranged to meet there I knew no one going into this event My tablemates all ended up being on the younger side and all were major rum enthusiasts The event organizers were quick to get a representative from Vintages up to the podium and get the night rolling Our main speaker for the night was Shaun Caleb the Master Distiller at El Dorado Shaun Caleb Shaun s passion for what he has accomplished and how he hopes to steer El Dorado s products was palpable The event was oversold with guests listening to Shaun describe the nose and palate of the first three rums He would run into the occasional short tangent about the sourcing of the barrels or the history of the stills which made it all the more captivating I could have listened all evening but the kitchen was ready to serve Note For full reviews please click on the title of each rum below El Dorado Hands down one of the best values in premium rums on the market Coming in at a reasonable brace yourselves Americans CAD this product is mid priced but easily outperforms many rums at much higher levels The smooth alcohol is flavoured with citrus spice banana and caramel IT has a very sweet bouquet and palate which is probably caused by this rum having quite a bit of added sugar El Dorado Red Wine Cask This is the yo rum aged an additional months in a char level cask that had been previously used for a Portuguese red wine It is quite amazing how much this affects the flavor profile of the product The citrus and especially the orange come through on the nose much more predominantly while it dries out the actual drink much like a full bodied red wine I enjoy some sweet rums and do not mind when sugar is added as one can tell by me liking El Dorado but this one comes to an anticlimactic ending with an overly sweet finish that was overpowering even for a sweet tooth like me El Dorado Dry Madeira Cask Again aged an additional months this time in a fortified Madeira Wine Cask The nose on this product was rather toned down compared to the previous rum Dried fruit and oak were predominant A very dry alcohol which had flavors of banana chips and pepper When I went back to the Red Wine version afterwards it made it taste almost unbearably sweet I enjoyed this one so much I bought a bottle for CAD First Dinner was an amazing five courses designed to pair with a corresponding rum from El Dorado We started with a roasted sweet potato bisque with a spiced granny smith apple brunoise and cinnamon oil drizzle I can t lie I only took a sip of the rum while eating because I was more interested in understanding the rum on its own then with food I took to sipping my rums after each course was finished for the rest of the night Single Barrel ICBU Distilled on a still originating in the ICBU single barrel rum has a sweet

My visit to the Key West Legal Rum Distillery,This visit was not planned I just popped in while I was in town As such I happened to be there during non production hours This means that there was no distiller there to give me a proper tour nor answer my questions however the barista was fairly knowledgeable and I was able to go into the distillery and look around for myself The distillery allows one free sample or for you can sample a variety and take home a souvenir shot glass The samples were served in single use plastic sacrament cups fitting for a Sunday morning All of them were served ice cold except for their aged rums which were served at room temperature The samples were sufficient to get a good taste of the rums Their rums are made from evaporated sugar cane not from molasses The rums Key West First Legal Rum This is a straight white rum It is surprisingly smooth It may be my new go to mixer for daiquiris as it has a basic rum flavor that is simple and pleasing and not too expensive Duval Street Spiced Rum This was the most surprising of the rums I sampled Forget about your typical spiced rum this is nothing like the usual stuff Not very sweet at all it was more reminiscent to me of bitters than spiced rum In fact one could use this to make a rum old fashioned and just leave the bitters out of the mix The barista confirmed only the presence of coriander and basil The strongest flavors to me were clove citrus coriander and basil Real Key Lime This is one of their various chef s rums I love key limes That said this rum would be better used for mixing than for sipping and I think the rum is not best sampled by tasting it straight as it is rather sour Not sweet or syrupy it tastes very much like rum and key lime juice Vanilla Brûlée Dark Another chef s rum this is also surprisingly less sweet than one might expect Caramel and vanilla are obviously strong players in this rum as well as a certain woody characteristic I am a huge fan of quality vanillas and thus I am put off by inferior vanilla flavors but this rum did not disappoint I brought a bottle of this home with me I would sip on this rum for the vanilla flavor but it would also be excellent for cooking or mixing Some sediment formed on the bottom of the bottle after a couple of weeks which I believe reflects the fact that this rum is an infusion of real vanilla and not imitation vanilla flavor Green Coconut Yet another chef s rum We ve all had the syrupy coconut rum that calls to mind suntan lotion This is not that rum Not particularly sweet it tastes more like fresh coconut water It would probably be good in a mixed drink but I would not use it in a piña colada as the coconut flavor is too subtle and would be wasted Key West Devil s Rum Basically this is cinnamon flavored rum In keeping with their other rums this is not terribly sweet or syrupy otherwise it calls to mind the cinnamon flavor of Fireball Whiskey Bad Bitch Rum Spanish Marie This was the first of the two aged varieties I sampled It was crafted and named in honor of the famous rum runner Marie Waite As such it is aged in wine barrels because she was recorded as having used whatever barrels were on hand which were often port wine barrels I have to say that for me this was my least favorite It is unique complex and rather interesting but perhaps because I m not a fan of tannic flavors and not a fan of wine in general I simply didn t care as much for it Aged Key West Raw and Unfiltered Rum Slightly cloudy and amber in color this tastes pretty much like you expect aged rum to taste I d call it a decent value Not as smooth as I would have hoped it easily passes as a sipping rum but not as a high end sipper I brought home a bottle for my collection and I think it will be good as a general mixing rum They do offer other rum flavors which were not on the sample menu including a cheaper version of their basic white rum and an overproof rum as well as a few other chef s

What in the name of God was Bacardi thinking when they made Black ,I m not much of a rum drinker mainly because I m poor as fuck I tried Shellback once which was like drinking cake frosting but my usual drink is Sailor Jerry The supermarket was having a sale on Bacardi so I went in intending to grab a bottle of Silver but then I saw the Black and read on the label that it s aged between one and three years in heavily charred oak barrels then shaped through a secret blend of charcoals Being more of a bourbon drinker I thought that sounded pretty good so I bought a bottle As soon as I opened it and took a whiff however I knew I d made a big mistake If you dissolved a bar of soap in a liter of store brand diet cola it would probably taste a lot like Bacardi Black It is the vilest alcohol I ve ever tasted and I ve tasted Ron Caballero rum It s as if an executive at Bacardi accidentally put a topical anti fungal cream on his toothbrush instead of toothpaste and when he tasted it he thought Hmm we should make a rum that tastes just like this I just can t imagine why any company would intentionally manufacture a product that tastes so godawfully bad So my question is this is there some real rum that tastes like this What was Bacardi aiming at ,2,What in the name of God was Bacardi thinking when they made Black  I m not much of a rum drinker mainly because I m poor as fuck I tried Shellback once which was like drinking cake frosting but my usual drink is Sailor Jerry The supermarket was having a sale on Bacardi so I went in intending to grab a bottle of Silver but then I saw the Black and read on the label that it s aged between one and three years in heavily charred oak barrels then shaped through a secret blend of charcoals Being more of a bourbon drinker I thought that sounded pretty good so I bought a bottle As soon as I opened it and took a whiff however I knew I d made a big mistake If you dissolved a bar of soap in a liter of store brand diet cola it would probably taste a lot like Bacardi Black It is the vilest alcohol I ve ever tasted and I ve tasted Ron Caballero rum It s as if an executive at Bacardi accidentally put a topical anti fungal cream on his toothbrush instead of toothpaste and when he tasted it he thought Hmm we should make a rum that tastes just like this I just can t imagine why any company would intentionally manufacture a product that tastes so godawfully bad So my question is this is there some real rum that tastes like this What was Bacardi aiming at

What s the difference between spiced rum and rum with spices ,I m not a huge fan of spiced rums mainly because most rums overdo the spices However many wonderful drinks have notes of cinnamon vanilla orange peel etc and don t call themselves spiced Are they spiced in such a way that they still warrant a traditional name For reference I am mostly referring to rums like Black Seal and Old Monk ,2,What s the difference between spiced rum and rum with spices  I m not a huge fan of spiced rums mainly because most rums overdo the spices However many wonderful drinks have notes of cinnamon vanilla orange peel etc and don t call themselves spiced Are they spiced in such a way that they still warrant a traditional name For reference I am mostly referring to rums like Black Seal and Old Monk

New to rum Can anyone answer my questions ,I picked up a few rums the other day to taste and compare To get straight to the point here are my questions I can t really find a good comparison of the El Dorado Year and the El Dorado Year My favourite rum right now is El Dorado I m wondering if the year tastes of oak a lot more something I don t want or if it s really worth the step up I could buy nearly two years for the price of one year so there has to be some good reason Are there any good spiced rums out there that are worth trying that aren t too sugary I have tried Kraken and I have tried Bacardi Oakheart Kraken is like a vanilla mystery sugar drink and oakheart is even more sugary and is like butterscotch Neither are bad I prefer the Kraken out of the two I like spiced rum but I don t want to waste a ton of money trying a slew of other brands only to find that it s just purely vanilla and rum flavor Has anyone tried Mount Gay XO I picked up a bottle to taste it and I don t actually get what is great about it It s bitter on the aftertaste neat and it mixes kind of harsh in coke I will revisit it I have the bottle but I m not sure if it s just me being inexperienced Right now my top two rums out of sampling or so would be the El Dorado and the Appleton Are there any similar rums you might recommend Both of these rums are distinctly different but I can say I am not a fan of Mt Gay or Flor De Cana The El Dorado is smooth sugary complex and tastes good no matter how you drink it The Appleton is more spicy not as smooth but it s complex and interesting no matter how you drink it ,2,New to rum Can anyone answer my questions  I picked up a few rums the other day to taste and compare To get straight to the point here are my questions I can t really find a good comparison of the El Dorado Year and the El Dorado Year My favourite rum right now is El Dorado I m wondering if the year tastes of oak a lot more something I don t want or if it s really worth the step up I could buy nearly two years for the price of one year so there has to be some good reason Are there any good spiced rums out there that are worth trying that aren t too sugary I have tried Kraken and I have tried Bacardi Oakheart Kraken is like a vanilla mystery sugar drink and oakheart is even more sugary and is like butterscotch Neither are bad I prefer the Kraken out of the two I like spiced rum but I don t want to waste a ton of money trying a slew of other brands only to find that it s just purely vanilla and rum flavor Has anyone tried Mount Gay XO I picked up a bottle to taste it and I don t actually get what is great about it It s bitter on the aftertaste neat and it mixes kind of harsh in coke I will revisit it I have the bottle but I m not sure if it s just me being inexperienced Right now my top two rums out of sampling or so would be the El Dorado and the Appleton Are there any similar rums you might recommend Both of these rums are distinctly different but I can say I am not a fan of Mt Gay or Flor De Cana The El Dorado is smooth sugary complex and tastes good no matter how you drink it The Appleton is more spicy not as smooth but it s complex and interesting no matter how you drink it

Question about Captain Morgan White Rum actually being rum ,I was reading the bottle of Captain Morgan White and they specify that it is distilled times Now by U S Law Rum is an alcoholic distillate produced at less than proof And I am just wondering based on my knowledge of distilling how is it possible that after five distillations it could possibly be less than proof Or is there some other way that they can get around the law just curious to know Thanks ,2,Question about Captain Morgan White Rum actually being rum  I was reading the bottle of Captain Morgan White and they specify that it is distilled times Now by U S Law Rum is an alcoholic distillate produced at less than proof And I am just wondering based on my knowledge of distilling how is it possible that after five distillations it could possibly be less than proof Or is there some other way that they can get around the law just curious to know Thanks

Does anyone else adore Panama Red rum ,I haven t seen much about this rum here but decided to pick up a bottle after seeing some good reviews on other sites and it might just be my new favorite rum It caught me off guard too since it is an overproof rum and has tits plastered on the label everything about the marketing suggests it s going to be a nasty stringent bottle of rum only meant to get college kids drunk but I promise you it s much better than that I m still new to rum and don t have the palette to give a full review but it has a really nice fresh fruit vegetal taste without the harsh alcohol taste you usually get younger rums The only problem I had with it is that it has a slightly off putting soapy metallic taste like the Havana Club and I m also going to guess that it has quite a bit of added sugar Other than that it s a great bang for your buck rum especially since how few of them there are in the Spanish style at least in BC most of the sub bottles here are in the hardier English style ,2,Does anyone else adore Panama Red rum  I haven t seen much about this rum here but decided to pick up a bottle after seeing some good reviews on other sites and it might just be my new favorite rum It caught me off guard too since it is an overproof rum and has tits plastered on the label everything about the marketing suggests it s going to be a nasty stringent bottle of rum only meant to get college kids drunk but I promise you it s much better than that I m still new to rum and don t have the palette to give a full review but it has a really nice fresh fruit vegetal taste without the harsh alcohol taste you usually get younger rums The only problem I had with it is that it has a slightly off putting soapy metallic taste like the Havana Club and I m also going to guess that it has quite a bit of added sugar Other than that it s a great bang for your buck rum especially since how few of them there are in the Spanish style at least in BC most of the sub bottles here are in the hardier English style

Rum Reviews Dominican Haul Bermudez Aniversario and Brugal ,My fiancé and I recently went on vacation in Punta Cana Dominican Republic While there I decided to take advantage of the phenomenal prices to pick up a couple of rums that I have been really looking forward to trying Bermudez Aniversario and Brugal The Dominican style of rum is quite similar to other Spanish style rums such as those from Cuba and Puerto Rico These rums tend to be light and clean with lots of woody oak character The rums I have selected definitely follow this trend and yet they could not be more dissimilar Let s have a look First up for review is the Bermudez Aniversario This rum is made in limited batches and bottled only once each year by the oldest distillery in the Dominican F Armando Bermudez Co The rum is aged as far as I can tell for somewhere between years and years in toasted white oak barrels The label itself while completely in Spanish boasts that this is a blend that is made with the most aged rums in the country I was really excited to be bringing this one home as it doesn t seem to be a rum I could ever obtain on the east coast of Canada For Dominican pesos CAD a bottle I jumped at the chance ABV In The Bottle I love the green glass bottle that this comes in To me the bottle is antique looking and very similar in shape to an old champagne bottle The label looks like it hasn t been updated since they first started making the stuff and that s just fine by me The label boasts award medals going back to Above the label is a slightly tacky looking gold coloured plastic emblem featuring the company s lion head logo In The Glass The Aniversario displays a deep gold hue in the glass with what I swear is a slightly pink highlight It s rather light in colour for a well aged rum but this is not unusual for naturally coloured spirits There s definitely no e here The legs run nice and slow down the sides but they re not chunky These are slim dancer s legs probably merengue dancer s legs Nose The nose is floral very buttery and earthy I detect butterscotch salt water taffy a briny sea breeze note coconut macaroon flan con leche sultana nutmeg a touch of coriander cinnamon lots of woody oak and vanilla honey There s a smokiness too as well as a slightly medicinal iodine note that I often get from Islay whisky such as Ardbeg but it is much lighter and more delicate here Sweet and salty kettle corn praline almonds and a grassy sugar cane note Like u thefatrumpirate I m noting some similarities between this and the Havana Club so much so that I had to try them back to back I must say that while both rums share similar iodine tang on the nose I much prefer the smell of the Aniversario The HC has a much sharper aroma that I find brittle and thin while the Bermudez is rich and warm and complex Taste Very nice dry rum character with a soft medium light mouthfeel Lots of butterscotch maple syrup something I ve never detected in a rum and vanilla fudge Lindt dark chocolate Madagascar cocoa fried banana slightly tangy lemon rind damp earth fresh cut grass golden brown sugar baklava Dominican coffee it must be the soil and slightly briny Final Thoughts A very pleasurable and well crafted rum This little beauty is complex with well defined aromas and flavours Like most Dominican rums that I ve tried the overarching themes are soft refined and smooth When this bottle runs out I will desperately miss it and will have to find some way of getting my ass back to the Dominican to pick up another bottle Grade The Brugal is a rum that claims to be tailor made for whisky lovers This seems appropriate seeing as Brugal was purchased in by The Edrington Group the same company that owns Macallan and Highland Park The influence on this rum is clear A rum that is double aged for at least years in charred American white oak barrels that once housed bourbon and again for another years in ex sherry butts I purchased this one from a little corner store and it was roughly the same as what I would pay at home for this one Dominican pesos or CAD I loved the Brugal XV let s see how this one stacks up ABV In The Bottle Gorgeous and elegant bottle with the gold and blue label embossed directly onto the glass The base of the bottle is super heavy and the stopper is quite possibly the best I ve ever encountered a tight fitting cork with a heavy gold coloured metal topper A small label affixed to above the base of the bottle indicates that this is a limited edition rum that was bottled in with a lot number of as well as the barrels used American and Spanish Oak The rum within is deep dark mahogany with a reddish hue In The Glass Very viscous and oily with fat droopy legs that meander down the sides of the glass at a Dominican pace not rushing very relaxed Nose Big blast of sherry almost Aberlour A bunadh esque minus the intense alcohol and barley sugar I m getting notes of brown sugar orange zest dolce de leche bourbon y vanilla notes plump cherries prunes medjool dates rum raisin ice cream nutmeg clove allspice cinnamon young coconut pulp mushy banana orange marmalade molasses on buttered brown bread woody oak All very clean and full and luscious Taste Succulent stone fruits cherries apricots medjool dates as well as raisins that vanilla from the bourbon cask rich and fruity wild flower honey marmalade brown sugar delicious sherry of course Intriguingly this rum is both dry and quite sweet in equal measures Like other rums from Brugal the mouthfeel on the is absolutely remarkable The Rumhowler described it as an ever so light impression of baking soda giving the spirit a softer than usual mouth feel That s about right on the rum glides across the tongue providing a pleasant tactile experience to compliment the rich taste and deeply fragrant aroma Final Thoughts I love this rum The Brugal is effectively the Aberlour A bunadh of rum for me right now The packaging is classy and unpretentious the nose is full and clean the taste is mouth wateringly delicious and again super refined and clean It just ticks so many boxes The only thing I regret is that the bottle I purchased in the Dominican is only bottled at ABV I could have purchased it at the local NBLC for at ABV Really this rum should be bottled at ABV at the very least in order to ensure maximum flavour Regardless this is still an outstanding rum Grade ,2,Rum Reviews Dominican Haul Bermudez Aniversario and Brugal  My fiancé and I recently went on vacation in Punta Cana Dominican Republic While there I decided to take advantage of the phenomenal prices to pick up a couple of rums that I have been really looking forward to trying Bermudez Aniversario and Brugal The Dominican style of rum is quite similar to other Spanish style rums such as those from Cuba and Puerto Rico These rums tend to be light and clean with lots of woody oak character The rums I have selected definitely follow this trend and yet they could not be more dissimilar Let s have a look First up for review is the Bermudez Aniversario This rum is made in limited batches and bottled only once each year by the oldest distillery in the Dominican F Armando Bermudez Co The rum is aged as far as I can tell for somewhere between years and years in toasted white oak barrels The label itself while completely in Spanish boasts that this is a blend that is made with the most aged rums in the country I was really excited to be bringing this one home as it doesn t seem to be a rum I could ever obtain on the east coast of Canada For Dominican pesos CAD a bottle I jumped at the chance ABV In The Bottle I love the green glass bottle that this comes in To me the bottle is antique looking and very similar in shape to an old champagne bottle The label looks like it hasn t been updated since they first started making the stuff and that s just fine by me The label boasts award medals going back to Above the label is a slightly tacky looking gold coloured plastic emblem featuring the company s lion head logo In The Glass The Aniversario displays a deep gold hue in the glass with what I swear is a slightly pink highlight It s rather light in colour for a well aged rum but this is not unusual for naturally coloured spirits There s definitely no e here The legs run nice and slow down the sides but they re not chunky These are slim dancer s legs probably merengue dancer s legs Nose The nose is floral very buttery and earthy I detect butterscotch salt water taffy a briny sea breeze note coconut macaroon flan con leche sultana nutmeg a touch of coriander cinnamon lots of woody oak and vanilla honey There s a smokiness too as well as a slightly medicinal iodine note that I often get from Islay whisky such as Ardbeg but it is much lighter and more delicate here Sweet and salty kettle corn praline almonds and a grassy sugar cane note Like u thefatrumpirate I m noting some similarities between this and the Havana Club so much so that I had to try them back to back I must say that while both rums share similar iodine tang on the nose I much prefer the smell of the Aniversario The HC has a much sharper aroma that I find brittle and thin while the Bermudez is rich and warm and complex Taste Very nice dry rum character with a soft medium light mouthfeel Lots of butterscotch maple syrup something I ve never detected in a rum and vanilla fudge Lindt dark chocolate Madagascar cocoa fried banana slightly tangy lemon rind damp earth fresh cut grass golden brown sugar baklava Dominican coffee it must be the soil and slightly briny Final Thoughts A very pleasurable and well crafted rum This little beauty is complex with well defined aromas and flavours Like most Dominican rums that I ve tried the overarching themes are soft refined and smooth When this bottle runs out I will desperately miss it and will have to find some way of getting my ass back to the Dominican to pick up another bottle Grade The Brugal is a rum that claims to be tailor made for whisky lovers This seems appropriate seeing as Brugal was purchased in by The Edrington Group the same company that owns Macallan and Highland Park The influence on this rum is clear A rum that is double aged for at least years in charred American white oak barrels that once housed bourbon and again for another years in ex sherry butts I purchased this one from a little corner store and it was roughly the same as what I would pay at home for this one Dominican pesos or CAD I loved the Brugal XV let s see how this one stacks up ABV In The Bottle Gorgeous and elegant bottle with the gold and blue label embossed directly onto the glass The base of the bottle is super heavy and the stopper is quite possibly the best I ve ever encountered a tight fitting cork with a heavy gold coloured metal topper A small label affixed to above the base of the bottle indicates that this is a limited edition rum that was bottled in with a lot number of as well as the barrels used

I need rum suggestions and questions answered ,First off I was never much of a drinker but years after being legally able to drink I decided to try and mix two thing I have always loved I have always loved rum candy and I love love love colas I got myself a mexican coke mixed it with Kraken delicious Kraken tastes nothing like rum candy however I mixed Kraken with Jarritos cola even better Kraken still didn t remind me of rum candy I tried Bacardi Oakheart with coke not as good Oakheart tastes gross by itself however Oakheart compliments Dr Pepper very well I tried mixing Sailor Jerry with colas even worse It is just like sweet and alcohol like no rum taste Zaya was a bust also too sweet not what I think of when I desire the taste of rum I also tried Captain Morgan Black and I couldn t tell if I liked it the ratios were way off Is there a rum that is like rum candy in taste Even one that tastes like buttered rum candy would be fine at this point Is my idea of rum taste just wrong Maybe Calypso but I can t find it What is in Kraken that I like so much I thought it was vanilla but Zaya and Sailor Jerry have a lot of vanilla and it is kind of gross and overly done Is it caramel or cinnamon or something Is Captain Morgan Black the same flavors as original just more Or are they different because I don t think I liked CM Black not sure What rums are like Kraken whatever its traits are Not necessarily black rums I don t know all the cocktail lingo for flavors I am looking for cola mixers I love cola Update Elements Lamb s Black Sheep and Lemon Hart are not sold at either liquor store I went to I instead bought a bottle of Gosling Black Seal and two smaller bottles of vast popularity to see if I liked them since Oakheart and Kraken were good Bacardi white and Original Captain Morgan in little bottles I just tried Captain Morgan Original and what first comes to mind is how insubstantial it is It tastes good and I like it better than Sailor Jerry but there isn t much there at all in terms of flavor depth complexity or even alcohol burn Bacardi Superior has a flash of vanilla that disappears very quickly into an alcohol taste I think I understand why this used strictly for mixing now I tried Gosling on the rocks and I liked it a lot actually It reminded me whiskey which might seem odd I don t generally enjoy whiskey either adding to the oddity of me liking it I can t wait to mix it tomorrow or maybe tonight Although it was not like rum candy at all I don t mind as it is quite unique and stands out from my now decent size collection Taking what Poopdish said I think Bacardi Gold may in fact be the most rum candy like at least by Bacardi s own description BACARDÍ Gold features rich vanilla buttery caramel toasted almond and sweet banana notes with the warm zest of orange peel and a light tasting oaky finish And they claim that it pairs well with cola Although they also say this about most of their rums But I have only ever heard nasty things about Bacardi Gold Are there other good gold rums I think Calypso made the rum candy I had about twelve years ago that I fell in love with If only I could find it Calypso rum Somebody on the Huffington Post described it as bubblegum esque Thanks everyone D Update I couldn t get any store to ship to where I live So no Amrut Old Port Deluxe for me No Lamb s no Lemon Hart no a lot of things I wanted to try I looked for Cruzan Single Barrel at my store no luck Came down to Bacardi year and El Dorado year I went with the El Dorado because I like RumHowler description of its flavors more It tastes much better in Jarritos than it does in Jones as far as cola goes But my budget is blown now My local liquor stores will stop carrying all but Superior and Gold Bacardis soon For a rum and cola did I choose wisely Anybody have both Bacardi and El Dorado and willing to share insight ,2,I need rum suggestions and questions answered  First off I was never much of a drinker but years after being

Beenleigh s year old,This review is split into two sections My first impressions and then what i thought about it about two and a half weeks later I bought this bottle of Beenleigh because despite being Australian ive never had much time for Australian rum and i thought making a change from Caribbean rums would be interesting First Impression As soon as i opened the cap and got a whiff i had a bad feeling about this one Medicine sweet cough medicine is all i can smell oh no what have i done I poured some hoped i was wrong and took a sip More medicine a sort of artificial cherry flavour medicine and very sweet What few flavours my limited palette can discern don t hang around very long and are drowned out by the all powerful medicine which also lingers for far too long Its like the flavour is stuck on the roof of my mouth I decide to put it away until i can buy some ginger beer I thought if i cant drink it neat at least ill be able to mix it The medicine flavour still shines through the ginger beer but its more of a counter note to the ginger now I still don t think it makes the best dark and stormy ive ever had goslings works better but its drinkable in this form Second Impression After drinking about half the bottle with ginger beer i go back to having the stuff neat Smells a lot better this time around and im not as overwhelmed Acetone banana maybe also some vanilla and caramel as you would expect Still has some of the cherry cough syrup smell but it seems more balanced and it gets quickly cut off by the alcohol The taste has also improved somewhat still very sweet and fruity but now the medicinal cherry only arrives at the end with the alcohol burn It then remains as the dominant lingering taste still somewhat unpleasant but less unpleasant than it was the first time At the moment that s all i can really say ive never been very good at describing what i can taste I think id like this rum a lot more if it were less sweet and balanced better The cough syrup is still just too strong I wouldn t buy a bottle again i wouldn t drink it straight but i could see how some might enjoy this rum straight or mixed Unless you live in Australia or its already at a reasonable price in your country i wouldn t buy it until you can try a sample Has anyone else tried it id be very curious to hear what you think of it Edit Have been drinking it with Tonic water now and its quite good almost reminds me a bit of campari and lemonade,2,Beenleigh s year old This review is split into two sections My first impressions and then what i thought about it about two and a half weeks later I bought this bottle of Beenleigh because despite being Australian ive never had much time for Australian rum and i thought making a change from Caribbean rums would be interesting First Impression As soon as i opened the cap and got a whiff i had a bad feeling about this one Medicine sweet cough medicine is all i can smell oh no what have i done I poured some hoped i was wrong and took a sip More medicine a sort of artificial cherry flavour medicine and very sweet What few flavours my limited palette can discern don t hang around very long and are drowned out by the all powerful medicine which also lingers for far too long Its like the flavour is stuck on the roof of my mouth I decide to put it away until i can buy some ginger beer I thought if i cant drink it neat at least ill be able to mix it The medicine flavour still shines through the ginger beer but its more of a counter note to the ginger now I still don t think it makes the best dark and stormy ive ever had goslings works better but its drinkable in this form Second Impression After drinking about half the bottle with ginger beer i go back to having the stuff neat Smells a lot better this time around and im not as overwhelmed Acetone banana maybe also some vanilla and caramel as you would expect Still has some of the cherry cough syrup smell but it seems more balanced and it gets quickly cut off by the alcohol The taste has also improved somewhat still very sweet and fruity but now the medicinal cherry only arrives at the end with the alcohol burn It then remains as the dominant lingering taste still somewhat unpleasant but less unpleasant than it was the first time At the moment that s all i can really say ive never been very good at describing what i can taste I think id like this rum a lot more if it were less sweet and balanced better The cough syrup is still just too strong I wouldn t buy a bottle again i wouldn t drink it straight but i could see how some might enjoy this rum straight or mixed Unless you live in Australia or its already at a reasonable price in your country i wouldn t buy it until you can try a sample Has anyone else tried it id be very curious to hear what you think of it Edit Have been drinking it with Tonic water now and its quite good almost reminds me a bit of campari and lemonade
