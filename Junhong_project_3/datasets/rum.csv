jrcaddell,vlbj6h,1,rum,Obtaining Interesting Rum Outside California or Europe,"(I ask this not entirely for my own sake, but hopefully to spread information for those who are interested.)

I follow a number of rum reviewers both here and in other corners of the internet. Any time I see positive review for some fascinating rum, be it a high ester Jamaican or a phenomenal face-melter from some new distillery, I think, ""Wow, I want to get some of that!"" Often, that rum is either completely unavailable in my area, or it's prohibitively expensive due to aftermarket pricing or shipping. 

So, for those who live in areas with poor distribution of interesting rum, where do you turn for interesting releases? Please don't respond with, ""Sorry, you're pretty much screwed."" *We know.* I'm hoping to get a conversation going about the few options we have, not the ones we don't. 

Here are my contributions:

1. Florida Rum Society - As someone on the east coast, this is one of the best sources of interesting rum. They may not ship to your state (they don't ship to mine), but if you have friends in a neighboring state they may be able to help. 
2. Chip's Liquors, San Diego - A California based shop with a fine selection, good customer service, and most importantly, wider availability for shipping. Shipping is a little pricy, but it's an option. 
3. Finedrams.com - An excellent, well-vetted shop based in Denmark. They haven't had any new rum releases in several months, but when they do get new stuff, it's going to be good. Expect long and somewhat costly shipping, but no VAT for U.S. orders and great customer service.
4. Rombo.dk - I heard about this one recently. Another Denmark based shop that's been tested and proven OK by some in this sub. A very different selection from anywhere else I've seen, and surprisingly affordable shipping. Just be careful to convert from DKK correctly.",0,2022-06-27 02:48:40

**80pf, $25-30ish, Fiji Rum Co. molasses rum in ex-bourbon, aged about 3ish years before vacationing for a year in France in French Oak. Dosed?**

The Summer of Drinking continues as a try to (mostly) finish off my liquor pantry.  Tonight isn't a bottle kill, but it is a bottle that's sat at about 1/3rd full for over 6 months from lack of rum interest.

**Nose** - acetone, coconut, faint hogo, very sweet

**Palate** - bananas foster, honey, vanilla, oak char

**Finish** -  bourbony/tropical fruit finish, oak; sweet on the verge of cloying, ripe bananas, then an offputting menthol throat spray note (Chloraseptic) at the very end.

**Overall** - This is pretty much in-line ratings-wise with the Jamaican high ester rums I've sampled neat -  In other words, not a great experience.  There's maybe some utility here as a mixer, but it doesn't have any proof to carry a drink so I'm not sure where I'd recommend this - you could either go Jamaican/high ester or to the other end with a aged non-dosed bottle and they'll do what this could do, but better.  It's honestly not terrible, but we're not loving what we're seeing here.  **65/100** Thanks for the read.",0,2022-06-28 12:30:37
Magicmango97,vmrt2i,1,rum,New to Rum and would like some pointers with similar taste.,"I am new to rum and want to buy 2 bottles this weekend to do a mini tasting with a friend. I currently have kirk and Sweeney Reserva (which is probably my favorite!). For a cheap alternative, I go with Largo bay for that almost vanilla flavor (although that one can get sickly after the 2nd or so shots worth.). I am not a fan of white rum really so I plan on sticking to darks.

My friends suggested looking into Diplomatico family reserva, 896 8 year, cruzan's black strap, and plantation (although I saw a post on here detailing some ethical issues with plantation so maybe not.)

What would be one the sweeter side or give that warm chest fuzziness that kirk and Sweeney offers that makes it go down easy.

Thank you for any direction folks!",0,2022-06-29 00:51:05

Karlahn,vmuqif,1,rum,Amber/Dark Rum Sipping/Cocktails,"Hi all,


I want a dark/amber rum that is good enough to sip but you wouldn't feel was wasted in a cocktail.

My current knowledge of rum is basically that there is white rum, IE for mojitos and dark rums for something like a Mai Tai, Dark n Stormy etc.

You guys have showed me it's much  more complicated. Part the reason I want a sipper is so I can understand the spirits a bit better but my main goal currently is to make cocktails so I don't want something too good for that.

Are there any websites that have a more nuanced overview of different types of rum? Please don't link me any books on the topic, I'm not ready for such a big commitment üòÖ

Also what's the deal with spiced rum? When would you use it exactly? I mean by its nice in a Cuba libre but otherwise I'm not sure when you'd choose it over a non-spiced rum.",0,2022-06-29 02:52:16

ga_southern,voqbsq,1,rum,"50th bday in Puerto Rico this week, tour of Ron Del Barrelito","Hello fellow drinkers.

As the title suggests, I'm bound for Old San Juan tomorrow and will be there for a week. On Monday we're taking a tour of Ron Del Barrelito and I'm looking forward to trying their rums.

It's my understanding they offer some rums that are only available on the island. I'm hoping the 4 star is good enough that I don't feel the need to spend on the 5 star.

As an avid whiskey drinker, it's going to be a switch up to likely drink mostly run during vacation. But I do love a good tiki drink, pain killer etc. 

While I'll enjoy some cocktails, it's going to be the better sipping runs that aren't too sweet that will be on my radar. If anyone has insights on San Juan, watering holes, and good rums to seek while in Puerto Rico, I'm all ears.

In my current collection: Doorlys 12, old dusty 80s Brugal, old dusty 86 Bacardi black, Richland Rum cask strength, St Augustine distillery rum.

3) 100% traditional column still - ""traditional rum""  
4) Rum containing industrial column still product - ""rum""

What I am looking for are some example brands or distillers that fall under number 3. This excludes all cuban/spanish heritage rums like DonQ and Angostura because they use industrial column product in all their blends. As far as I can tell it also excludes ""English"" style distilleries on Grenada like Clarke's Court and on Antigua like English Harbour, as both places use a multi column set up, even if they don't distill to super high ABV levels.

I can't think of a single traditional column still product (something falling under category 3) that is commonly available in the United States. \[I know there were some special Guyana releases that would have qualified by I don't have access to those!\]

DonnyA7382,uzzpz0,1,rum,My rum journey and request for guidance,"Hi all. Lurking a while but thought I would finally ask for guidance. Thought I would post my rum journey in the hopes that it helps.

First, let me apologize ahead of time lol for the ignorant, newbie post. I've hung out at enough specialty/niche boards to know these kinds of posts can be annoying. If it's any consolation, I really do want to learn and really do want to up my rum game.

So my rum journey started about 10 years ago at age 45ish. Interestingly enough, I was at happy hour with an intoxicated boss trying to fend her off from taking me back to her place. So I turned the conversation to why she ordered all her drinks with top-shelf liquor? I myself was drinking Jack-n-Cokes - my go to at the time. She said it really made a difference, esp the next morning. So I ordered my next rum-n-coke with whatever top-shelf rum they had. It was Private Stock. At the time,  I didn't know PS was CM's top-shelf rum.  When I took my first sip, I pissed myself. The difference was night and day.

After that day, I began stocking up on PS at home and trying to learn more about rum online.  Perusing my local, mega-grocery store one day, I spotted Zaya. I was intrigued. A blend of rums aged 12 years. I tried it, and it immediately replaced my PS. Zaya continues to be my regular go-to rum, although it is VERY sweet and I have to cut it usually.  I have also been purchasing additional rums to try - either at home or when out.

In the last 5 years and in addition to Private Stock and Zaya, I've tried Myer's Original, Pyrat XO Reserve, Kasama Small Batch, Sailor Jerry Spiced, The Kraken Black Spiced, Pusser's Original &amp; Mount Gay Eclipse. My current go-tos are Zaya for mixed and Pusser's for mixed or straight with a splash of water.

I will sheepishly admit that I have never tried white rum but am curious what you, all, thought of it? Should I include it in my exploration? Most of my exploration has not taken be beyond local grocery stores and a couple specialty stores within a few miles. But I am willing to travel a dozen or so miles for a better rum if that is the only location near me selling it.  Also, any good online retails are appreciated. I am in the U.S. 

So what am I after? I would like to find a rum that I can learn to sip, neat and unadulterated - no mixer, no water, no ice. Pusser's was the only one that came close to me doing that, but it was still too harsh for me, so I add a splash of water when I don't feel like Coke with it. Also, I am not a fan of bourbon, so would probably not like rums that lean in that direction.

Suggestions are most welcome!

YinTx,v01yvk,1,rum,Tasting notes for Doorly's XO,"So I had bought a Doorly's 12, and really really liked it.  Thought I'd try the other expression from them as well.  I've had about half of the XO, so here are my notes over several sittings with it.

40% bottling.

Neat, 1 oz pour in a very small ( 3 oz or so) snifter.  No idea where I got the glass, but I like it.  Rested 5 minutes.

nose: sweet, light oak, sugar cane, brown sugar, toffee/caramel, vanilla creme brulee. sweet light raisin, slight sweet smoke, very pleasant. slight funk? plastic? This is Spanish Olorosa sherry cask finish I believe. 

Palate: initial sharp bite/prick on the center of the front of the tongue, dry but sweet. brief memory of driving in the ‚Äô68 Ford truck in the  mountains. (maybe triggered by the very faint funk/oily dusty smoke plastic smell/taste?) Sweet, oak, slightly brash but in a good way, not harsh, definite rummy flavor. slight coconut. other tropical fruit (mango?). 

Finish:  medium short finish, sweet, very enjoyable. Although 5 minutes into the finish, still getting pineapple, coconut, mango.  Almost too easy to drink neat. Pepper in the finish

This one is much milder and more subtle than the 12.  I did try to mix it with cola, and it pretty much disappeared.  I enjoyed it, but I also like the more intense experience from the 12.  Still have the 5 and the 8 to try out!

side note, when something can trigger a pleasant memory, I drop it in the notes.  Might not mean anything to anyone but me, but I love it when that happens!",0,2022-05-29 10:40:43

logan2231993,v0i9y2,1,rum,looking for some help with rum.,"Hey everyone I am currently looking for some rum, I am going to be using it for a home made Kahlua recipe 

Making about 5 fifths worth and I need something that is on the inexpensive side (only because this is my first batch and I don't know what it's going to taste like) 
I am looking for something that is very dark very sweet and very flavorful. 

I'm not looking for a barrel specific flavor (not looking for okay or woody or even earthy flavors necessarily) what I am looking for is vanilla/molasses and possibly a bit of fruit in there too if found at a reasonable price. 

The reason I am looking for these flavors is because I would like to add to the coffee and vanilla flavors that are already present in this recipe for Kahlua. 

I have thought of kraken, Myers, possibly sailor Jerry's, admiral Nelson's black patch. Bacardi black, dead man's fingers (spiced or coffee). 

Have I missed any that are right around these price ranges?

If not, is there any that anyone here can help me decide on?

Thanks guys.",0,2022-05-30 03:19:29

I‚Äôm just now deep diving into Rhum Agricoles so his offer is incredibly well timed. For reference, some of my recent acquisitions in that category (or adjacent) include Pierre Labat 59, Providence Dunder &amp; Syrup, Rhum J.M. Blanc 100pf, and the Barbosa Amado &amp; Vicente Grogue. Pretty sure I have access to all the Clarins here in DC, at least the Spirit of Haiti Line and will get them eventually.

Melonskal,v6812g,1,rum,Looking for some advice,"Hello everybody!

At this point I have tried quite a few rums, mostly spanish ones like Ron Zacapa, Diplomatico selecion de familia, ron abuelo and ron cristobal. I have also tried a few english style ones like Mount gay XO, el dorado 12 year and worthy park. The latter one truly had some ""funk"" and smelled intensely of bananas which caught my interest. 

I have been looking to widen my horizons a bit and 1. Buy a French-style agricole rhum and 2. A funkier Jamaican rum.

The problem is that I live in Sweden and all alcohol sales go through a state owned coorporation called ""systembolaget"" so sadly the rum selection is limited to what they decide to import. I have looked through all avalible rums and found 2 of each type that interests my and are in a reasonable price range.

geraniumreese,uere8z,1,rum,Help identifying gaps in my collection,"Hi all! Recently getting more into rum and I‚Äôm looking to see what major categories I might be missing, which I‚Äôve been having trouble identifying on account of how varied rum can be. I would love some suggestions or just to talk shop. Here‚Äôs what I have. I mostly make cocktails (and am getting into tiki) but I am also not averse to sipping a good bottle neat.

Bacardi Silver (belongs in the trash)

Bully Boy Boston Rum (aged, column (?) still, a good middle of the road bottle)

Bully Boy White Rum (presumably the same or similar but filtered)

Plantation 5 Year (solid, reliable, not too exciting, but not everything should be exciting, I probably won‚Äôt replace this but good to have something that fits the same niche)

Gosling‚Äôs Black Seal (I don‚Äôt love it but it isn‚Äôt awful. Would love to find a nicer replacement for this approximate type of thing)

Pusser‚Äôs Original (potential Gosling‚Äôs replacement? Unsure where it fits amongst guyanese rums)

Hamilton Jamaican Pot Still Black (for something dark and funky)

Hamilton Demerara 151 (haven‚Äôt tried this one yet, just bought it)

The Rum Cooperative, vol. 1 (a fabulous blend, predominantly Panama/Dominican, rich and sweet without being too dark)

The Rum Cooperative, vol. 2 (the bulk of this blend is from Martinique, so it has a nice bright grassy cane note. Made the best Daiquiri I‚Äôve ever had)

Leblon Cacha√ßa (I don‚Äôt like this very much. I‚Äôd prefer to try a real agricole. This tastes pretty unrefined to me)

Van Oosten Batavia Arrack (also just got this, excited to mix with it more)

Hamilton Pimento Dram (for various cocktail needs)

I know I‚Äôm missing a white overproof like Rum Bar or Rum Fire or W&amp;N, but other than that I don‚Äôt really know what categories of rum are the next to focus on. I often hear specs call for a demerara rum; is Pusser‚Äôs a good use for that or should I try to grab an El Dorado? Cuban rum? Mount Gay? Real McCoy? Good agricoles? Would love some advice. My budget is also limited so I‚Äôm big on a value buy, but want to avoid dosed rum as much as is practical. Cheers!",0,2022-04-30 01:46:25

As I find myself drinking less these days, I'm going through bottles slower and  am looking for an upgrade for when I replace these. I use these for cocktails, so I don't necessarily need sippers, but I don't mind spending a bit more than before.

For blended Aged rums, I've enjoyed Plantation 5 year and anything from Foursquare (Doorleys, Real McCoy). Pussers was not my favorite and I couldn't place why.

I don't know much about white rums. Maybe Probitas should be my next bottle?

Bottles in my collection (would like to avoid overlaps in types):

* Smith &amp; Cross
* Plantation Xaymaca extra dry
* Wray &amp; Nephew
* Hamilton Jamaican Pot Still
* Hamilton Guyana 151
* Real McCoy 12 year
* Plantation Stiggins Fancy
* Clement XO Agricole
* Neilson Agricole
* Kohana Agricole
* Barbancourt 8 year
* Leblon cachaca
* Batavia Arrack
* Flor de Cana 4 year

Neurogenesi5,ug6twu,1,rum,House Bottles for Cocktails,"So I wanted to see what people use as their house bottles for tiki drinks. I recently moved from a state with limited options and need to get up to speed. The query is specifically for what you stock as your ‚Äúhouse‚Äù rums to toss into a cocktail. 

I usually keep a bottle of plantation 5 or the real McCoy 5 around for most drinks. When I need a **blended rum**, something rummy without funk, these are my bottles.

For **white rum** I usually have plantation 3 and a bottle of rum fire if we need the funk.

For **dark rum** I‚Äôll either do plantation OFTD. 

I need an **agricole** that people use consistently and any other recs you have.

I know there‚Äôs a much broader spectrum of bottles to have (Smuggler‚Äôs Cove the book gets a lot of love at my house) but I can‚Äôt maintain a 20 bottle rum bar in my current space. Believe me I wish I could. 

(For sippers I go Hampden or the single cask transcontinental or plantation versus Foursquare. I wouldn‚Äôt use those in mixes)

While I don't mind spending money on good stuff, for cocktails there is certainly a point of diminishing returns on the overall quality of the cocktail from using a high end, more expensive rum versus a lower end and more affordable one. 

I'm curious what more affordable rums (think less than $30) you all would recommend for these two cocktails. For our Old Cuban's I've been using Mt. Gay XO which unfortunately I can't get here in PA and for Old Cubans I've been using the local distillery Maggie's Farm dark rum which has been solid for a while but now the fiancee says she gets a licorice flavor she doesn't like.

My staple drinking/session rum is the above James cook medium rum. Shock horror! But this rum is cheap and it tastes better than most other rums from supermarkets or retail. I prefer rums at ¬£35 and above but I can't drink those every weekend, so James Cook it is!

Plantation Panama 2002 was the first 'real' bottle of rum that I bought myself going back some years. I recently saw the Panama 2008 pop up and with such a beautiful label, my interest was piqued. The tasting notes looked good so I've had my eye on it. When the Jamaican 2008 recently popped up with a similar label and even nicer sounding tasting notes, I pulled the trigger and ordered them both. The ABVs are slightly higher than a bog standard 40% (45.7% and 48.4%) so I justified the purchase to myself.

I realise that Plantation add sugar to their rums but my cabinet is getting a little too serious as of late, so fancied something a bit fun (&amp; probably sweet) for those nights when I crave a sugar hit, although, having just read the blurb neither bottle supposedly has added sugar:

Plantation Rum 2008 Panama is a molasses rum from the Alcoholes Del Istmo distillery. The rums that make up this blend are from a selection of 19 barrels. The 2-3 day fermentation was preceded by a column distillation, followed by 12 years of ageing in a tropical climate, in bourbon barrels. The rum was then further matured in France, in barrels that had contained Ferrand cognac. No dosage was carried out on this 13 year old rum, which means that it has no added sugar.

Plantation Rum 2007 Jamaica had a long fermentation of 3 to 4 days - this molasses rum was distilled in the Vend√¥me ""Double-retort"" still of the legendary Clarendon distillery in Jamaica. The rum was aged on site for 13 years in 200-litre bourbon barrels, and then 2 more years in France in 350-litre cognac barrels. Bottled in 2022 with no added sugar, this vintage rum has an ester content of 102 grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol.

I popped both corks earlier for a quick sniff. The Panamanian smells like cherry, apricot/peach and some camphor coming through. The Jamaican smells like sweet tropical fruit &amp; pineapple. Excited to try them both. I will report back with my findings! :D",0,2022-03-29 21:34:18

4 cups Coffee, Extra Strong
2.5 cups Sugar
2.5 cups brown sugar
750 ml rum, unspiced, non-Jamaican
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 vanilla bean, split
Aged 1 month.

Does anyone have experience with homemade kahlua and have recommendations? Especially for which rum to use. My initial intuition is to avoid the alternative flavorings of a spiced rum, that the ""funk"" of a Jamaican would be really out of place in the expected flavor profile of a coffee rum liqueur, and that a really nice sipping rum would be wasted in the mix. The shortlist that I'd come up with based on recommendations I read here are

Old New Orleans

Hamilton Demerara/151/Navy Strength

Bacardi 8 Year

Babancourt 8

Denizen's Merchant Reserve

I enjoyed doorlys 12 but I think if I tried that before 2009 I might have decided that I'm not a rum guy. There wasn't enough complexity. Along the lines of 'this is great but maybe not for me'.

With that in mind I'm looking for a funky Jamaican rum that I can sip neat. I've seen Smith and Cross suggested but I'm worried that I'll have the same experience I did with Doorly's 12 where oh this is cool for someone else. I'm wondering if it might be better for me to buy great house 2021 or Hampden 46. 

Let me put it this way, I want to experience the funk. My impression is that great house is really good but maybe not as funky. Will it give me the experience of Jamaican funk?

This is probably a little out of left-field but I am currently trying to adapt a recipe from Noma where they infused brandy with blackened apples. While I like brandy a fair bit, it isn't really my favorite spirit, so I was hoping that you guys could give me some recommendations on rums that could pair well with something between a baked apple and apple leather.

This is a process that takes 1-2 years, so I plan on making a couple batches in quick succession and then letting them do their thing, and hoping that one or more of them works out. As a result, I'm happy to try multiple kinds, however I am also trying to keep the price point fairly low (&gt;$40/750ml) since I'm pretty sure one or more of these is not going to turn out well. Any input or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",2,2022-03-04 11:59:52

I find an increasing number of rums aged for 12 years or more quite ‚Äúmeh‚Äù as well as expensive and getting more so as well as woody and dumbed down character. At the other extreme I am warming to lightly aged rums from quality makers like Neisson, Rhum JM  and Clairins. The Neisson Profile 105 and Rhum JM Volcanique are stunning sipping examples. Aged between 12-14 month they have a brightness, herbal freshness and savoury smokiness which is harder to find in older expressions. Due to their youth they are more affordable as well as incorporating higher proofs which brings out their sparkling character even more. The Neisson is 54.2 ABV and the JM is 49% ABV.

JonathanWPG,sgid65,1,rum,Stepping up my sipping rum game.,"Looking for some suggestions for nicer sipping rums. Let's say...$70-$150 range. Not gonna drop for a bottle of Final Consignment or anything but still nice enough that it's a Special Occasion drink to pull down when someone's over. 

I have a pretty diverse pallet and am open to diverse suggestions but generally speaking I prefer my sipping rums to be on the sweeter, funkier side. I don't DISLIKE brighter Agricoles or Spanish rums but I generally prefer those funk, brown sugar, demerara, tobacco, roast nut kinda flavors. 

Current Special Occasion sipper is Plantation 20th Anniversary. Which I like a lot. 

Go-to weeknight tipples include El Dorado 12, Appleton 8-12, Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, Mount Gay Black Barrel.

For the record: I deeply do not card about if a rum is dosed. I'm not gonna tell anybody else what they should and should not care about but I am also deeply uninterested in hearing a bunch of comments trying to convince me of the superiority of the ""pure"" product. I care only about price vs taste and I quite like the sweeter finishes on things like the Plantation, El Dorado and Diplomatico.

$75 is a big investment on a single bottle for me. 
So I walked out with Privateer Queen's Share ($45) instead. This has been on my list to try for a long time- I know they're very different rums.

So I have a couple questions: 

1. Is the Foursquare hype real? 
2. Is it worth me dropping $75-100? What's the right price?
3. Which Foursquare bottle do I try first?
4. Is it noticeably different than Doorly's?

I have a bottle of Doorly's 12 on the shelf that I very much enjoy.

Thanks in advance!

Randomly came across this sub when searching for my next adventure. To make a long story short, I love rum, I love cola, I love putting them in a glass together and drinking. Recently, the typical stuff (Captain, Bacardi, etc..) has not been hitting the spot and is almost too sweet. So, I‚Äôm looking for a mixing rum that would go well with some cola but have a little ‚Äúbite‚Äù to it. 

I‚Äôve tried stronger stuff, I‚Äôve tried different rum to cola ratios but it‚Äôs just more alcoholic without adding that ‚Äúbite‚Äù, so to speak. Was hoping this group might have some suggestions on a great rum to hit this spot. I appreciate any and all advice and hope everyone has a great weekend ahead!",0,2022-02-05 05:24:34

I've been hanging out on the funky end of the rum spectrum for the most part, but I've seen a number of posts reminding me that the classic daiquiri is made with Spanish-style white rum. Flor de Cana 4 seems to be pretty well recommended, so I thought I'd give it a try. (Side note, what other options are there in the American market? I can only think of Bacardi and Havana Club).

It's, uh, not really my thing. 90% of what I get from it is the rubbing alcohol note that a lot of vodka has. Maybe a little bit of coconut or something toasty in the background. But mostly rubbing alcohol. It cuts right through the daiquiri I made and gives it a really off taste (to me).

1. Did I get a bad bottle?
2. Is this what Spanish-style white rums are typically like?
3. If so, maybe y'all can help me reframe my understanding of it? Perhaps it's something I can grow to like if I learn to find the nuance in it. Maybe my palette is burnt out from drinking Clairin Le Rocher, Rivers Antoine, and Rum Fire, I don't know.

free_slurpee_day,rqlc9c,1,rum,Dark Rum Recommendations,"I'm kind of a rum newbie, looking to get a bottle of dark rum (on a budget). I was going to go with Goslings but heard the sweetening was low quality so figured I would ask the experts for recommendations.

I like to drink rum n' cokes, dark n' stormys, old fashioneds, daiquiris, and also mojitos (although I know dark rum isn't the best choice for that). 

I want something rich, with caramel and molasses and baking spice flavors with nice sweetness but not overboard. I don't particularly like smokey or funky flavors.

I have tried Baccardi Black, which tasted like a rum version of Jack Daniels, Plantation Barbados 5, which was good but not rich enough, and El Dorado 8, which I think I liked but it was so long ago. For what it's worth, my usual spirit of choice is a nice spicy 100 proof rye whiskey.

Again, I am on a budget. Just wondering if there's anything better than Goslings around its price range. NYC based. TIA!",4,2021-12-29 01:47:55

I enjoyed it more than I expected. Smooth, sweet flavor but not too sweet. 

What other white rum brands should I try (keeping in mind that this for consuming neat and *not* in a mixed drink)? Recommendations would be appreciated. I already tried looking in the sidebar, but most of the white rum answers were geared toward mixed drinks.

P.S. I also tried some spiced Captain Morgan. It was okay‚Äîdidn't hate it, didn't love it. I prefer the ""simpler"" flavor of the white rum. I'm open trying other non-white rums if someone here thinks it might be a better fit for my needs.

Thus comes the dilemma: what are some alternatives to their products that fit the same purpose?

Plantation 3 Stars has been my go-to white rum for some time now, although I will occasionally switch to Diplomatico Planas or Havana Club 3. Open to other alternatives too.

Plantation Stiggins' Fancy Pineapple is a personal favourite of mine and while I've yet to discover anything else like it, a local distiller here in New Zealand named Black Collar recently released their own Pineapple rum, so that might scratch the same itch for me.

But Plantation OFTD... Just seems irreplaceable. It's so ridiculously good for such a modest price, and it's widely available. The balance of funk and sweetness from the blend, the way it disguises its ABV so well... This rum just hits the spot for me, but I'd like to know what the best alternatives are for folks who'd prefer not to support Plantation.

Good people of /r/rum, what can you recommend to someone who loves the Plantation OFTD? For reference, I like the OFTD a few different ways: neat, slightly diluted, rum old fashioned, mai tai, zombie etc.",0,2022-01-01 07:00:48

Marcus_Lilly,rw57h0,1,rum,White vs spiced Captain Morgan,I drank when I was younger but I have started drinking again because of drug tests. I have a question about the prices of rum. Right before New years they had captain Morgan spiced rum on sale for 26.99 a handle. I decided after new years to get some more rum. I went back and it was jacked up to 34.99 a handle. However they had captain Morgan white for 19.99 for the same size. Why such a price difference. Esspecially since the white has a higher alcohol content. 70 proof vs 80 proof. From what I have read on my own the white is a spiced rum as well. I have yet to drink any yet because I just got it. I just thought the price difference was a bit crazy.

It's probably something beginners like, people who like sweet drinks. Bought a bottle of Diplomatico and a The Real McCoy, both taste too much like alcohol to be the one I tried. About that price range, maybe 50% more. Happened in Scandinavia, so whats available here.

Blue4thewin,qkf3a7,1,rum,Modified Milk-Washed Dead Rabbit Philadelphia Fish House Punch," 

With the holidays coming up, I have this thought of creating a milk-wash version of the Dead Rabbit's Philadelphia Fish House Punch recipe. Wanted to see if anyone has tried to do this with this recipe or had any proposed suggestions. I have milk-washed cocktails and spirits many times before, but not with the amount of labor-intensive (either through actually making the sherbet and milk-washing or sourcing the various spirits required) so I want to make sure I get it right. I typically do a 4:1 ratio of cocktail ingredients to whole milk. The original Dead Rabbit version envisions a punch bowl with a large block of ice leading to dilution. My thought is, if I milk-wash it, not only will I get the benefits of the milk-wash, but I also will dilute it enough so it does not need to sit on ice in a punch bowl. My intention is to make these into individual, bottled cocktails, that people can grab and go from a ice-and-salt filled cooler. Below is my proposed recipe:

Proposed Modified Milk-Washed Dead Rabbit Philadelphia Fish House Punch recipe:

* 5 oz lemon sherbet 
* 10 oz Laird's Applejack Bonded Proof
* 3.5 oz Probitas
* 3.5 oz Smith &amp; Cross
* 3 oz Cruzan Blackstrap Rum
* 5 oz Giffard Cr√®me de P√™che de Vigne
* 7.5 oz fresh lemon juice
* 1/3 oz Angostura Bitters
* 250 ml of whole milk
* Fresh nutmeg grated on top for garnish

I would milk-wash it using David Arnold's technique from Liquid Intelligence.

I would appreciate any and all feedback or suggestions. Cheers!",2,2021-11-01 22:23:48

Other than independent bottlers which are priced in the &gt;$100 range, Jamaican Pot stills and Barbados Rum is hard to find where I live. I can get W&amp;N Unaged OP, Rum Bar Unaged OP, Plantations Xaymaca, and sometimes S&amp;C and for Bajan rum all that's available is Real McCoy and Plantations 5 Year. The Rum Nation offerings are pretty affordable though. I would like to know what distilleries they're from before pulling the trigger though. I read on their site that they don't put that info on there for marketing reasons. 

If not, would any of those be worth trying? I just want to try something different than what's available. I just don't want to waste my money on something that's pretty much the same as what I can get for cheaper. 

Real McCoy is priced at $50 &amp; $75 for their 5 &amp; 12 year and the Rum Nation is $66. The 5 year Jamaican is $66 and the closest thing I can get to it here would be $75 or more and the Jamaican Unaged OP is $10 more than W&amp;N and the Rum Bar for reference.",12,2021-11-05 02:27:47

What I'm looking for is a rum that I can get a nice sweet rum flavour while being somewhat smooth. Rather not have strong alcohol after taste but I love the rum flavour so strong flavour and minimal alcohol taste would be great.

Any tips on the type of rum and any brands? I may try on the rocks eventually but this is for piss-ups where you play beer pong etc, but I don't like beer so rum if that makes sense.

only-mansplains,pzjedq,1,rum,Identifying and trying to solve supply problems in the Canadian rum market: My thoughts and a request for others to share their experience trying to explore Tiki and Rum north of 49.,"**The Problem**

In the last 2 years that I've been getting into rum and Tiki, I've continually ran headfirst into the problem that I suspect most other Canadian users who casually browse here have as well: Rum availability both in terms of country of origin and distillery variety quite frankly sucks north of the American border.


The LCBO are notorious for understocking and price gouging, and although less regulation in my home province of Alberta is touted as making it a better market for spirits, it mainly manifests itself in whiskey availability out here. I cannot speak for every province in the country, but I suspect the same problem pops up elsewhere. Stores are stocked to the gills with the full lineup of mass-market brands such as Lambs, Appleton, Captain Morgan and Bacardi, and the majority of anything outside of those staples usually consist of ""premium"" heavily dosed Latin rons such as Zacapa 23, Diplomatico or stuff like Bumbu. 

This leaves a dearth in many of the categories and rums used in mixing and especially in classic Tiki recipes. Compounding on this problem is that I find many of the online guides and suggestions tend to assume you have access to American or UK availability which vastly outstrip Canadian offerings. Resources such as Smugglers Cove and Minimalist Tiki are tremendously useful here, as they break down different country of origin and styles to use and give many different possible substitutions and alternatives within a single style rather than just telling you to buy a Hampden or Hamilton blend within the style.

However, there are still some unavoidable gaps that I'd like to specifically address, ask for feedback on how best to get around them, and offer some of my own crude but thought-out solutions.

**The Biggest Gaps in the Market**

*  Agricoles

In my experience, this is by far the least available type of rum in Canada. Unaged AOCs simply do not exist here. If a recipe specifically calls for an unaged Agricole you should just give up and skip it in my opinion.

Aged Agricoles offer a tiny bit more leeway. Clement VSOP is rarely in stock in some liquor stores and is an acceptable choice if you're making something like 3 Dots and a Dash. However, I would controversially suggest just using Barbancourt 5 star instead due to its far greater availability and affordability. Haiti does not have rules as stringent as Martinique AOC and their distillation process is somewhat different from what I understand, but having both back to back I think it is a reasonable substitution for the subdued cane sugar profile.

*  Lightly aged Jamaican rum or ""dark"" Jamaican rum

This isn't as glaring of a weakness in Canada, but you will very often see recipes calling for something like Hamilton Pot Still Black, Dr. Bird, Smith &amp; Cross etc in Tiki Drinks these days that I have never seen on the shelves in Canada. They are highly praised for giving drinks a big molasses and dunder kick that stand up well in cocktails. Now you could just use Appleton Estate Signature as it's a decent lightly aged Jamaican, but in terms of flavor profile it will be missing a tonne of funky punch from all of those other rums. My suggestion is if you see a cocktail using Smith and Cross or Hamilton black, is to just mix one of the widely available unaged Jamaican Overproofs (Rum Bar, Wray and Nephew) for some extra dunder punch with an aged or lightly aged ""dark"" Jamaican rum such as Coruba or Appleton 12 to approximate the same color and keep your DIY blend 100% Jamaican.

* British Navy Rum

For the life of me, I cannot find Pusser's Gunpowder proof, and Hamilton Navy is of course out of the question. From what I understand, ""Navy Rum"" historically changed over time and did not have a set and static blending, but in terms of what we come to expect ""Navy Rum"" to mean in today's cocktail parlance is a rum that's around 55-57% made up of 60% demarara rum and 40% Bajan and/or Trinidad rum.

Understanding that ballpark, we can then replicate something close by simply taking Lemon Hart 151 and blending it 1:1 with any of the Angostura offerings or Mount Gay Eclipse if you're in the mood for a Painkiller.

**Playing to our Strengths**

We have one big advantage over our American counterparts in that we have easy access to pretty good Cuban rum in the form of Havana Club. I propose that we get our mind out of the Tiki fascination more often, and return to pre-prohibition and pre-Cuban revolution tradition.

Buy a bottle of HC3 and HC7 and go hog wild with Mary Pickford's, Daiquiris, Mojitos, Cuba Libres, El Presidentes etc. I guarantee you these drinks are all delicious and simple and really highlight quality cuban rum.

Additionally, for whatever reason aged DDL and Appleton products are relatively very cheap in Canada. Now that El Dorado rums aren't dosed anymore, there's no reason not to have a bottle of ED12 and Appleton 12 when they're both $30-35 Canadian consistently. Those 2 bottles together make a great if untraditional Mai Tai.

**Wrap-up**

What are your thoughts on Canada's rum availability? Am I off the mark in your opinion in terms of what you can buy and what our biggest holes are? Have you felt held back when trying to explore rum because of our availability problem, or do you try and come up with solutions like seeking out very specialty stores or crossing the border to find staples that aren't available in Canada?

Do you find it worthwhile to try and make DIY substitutions like some of my examples in this post, or is it a fool's errand? For Americans that have access to all of the rums I mentioned in this post- how realistic are my own substitutions and should I just not try and make a drink if it calls for a specific rum?

So does anyone know anything about it such as how aged is the rum? Also is there a rum that would taste similar to this that I can get here in Southern California? Thanks for the information.",5,2021-10-03 09:56:52

antonito901,q15rzc,1,rum,"I am able to make a decent Mai Tai, Jungle Bird, Daiquiri and Dark n Stormy. What would naturally comes next?","Hi all,

For the last months, I happily practiced these 4 cocktails that I feel comfortable to do properly now. I am also glad that they don't require hundreds of unique products and some of them can be re-used in more than one cocktail (S&amp;C, Appleton, basic sugar syrups). I was really glad to discover Campari based cocktail like the Jungle Bird. My wife initially was fan of Mai Tai but now definitively is a Jungle Bird fan, less boozy. I also like the fact that these cocktails are quite straightforward to prepare. I bought some bitters but I don't know what to do with them, tried a Rum Old Fashioned but it did not work out that well, missed the lemon/acidity flavor. 

What would you recommend as the next cocktail (tiki or not) worth to try without burning my budget?

My current set:

\- Appleton 12

\- Smith &amp; Cross

\- Clement VSOP

\- Havana 3

\- Gosling's Black Seal Bermuda Black

\- Demerara 15 (for sipping)

\- Foursquare 2008 (for sipping)

\- Campari

\- Orgeat syrup

\- Angostura Bitter Classic (not much used so far)

\- Angostura Bitter Orange (not much used so far)

\- simple/rich syrups",48,2021-10-04 21:47:38

I've only realized recently that I enjoy the fine sipping rums and am trying to educate myself and learn what types I like best.  Last weekend I had a flight at the Rum Bar in Key West (360+ rums on-hand!) and I really liked two of them - the Dos Maderas 5+5 and the Frigate Reserve 15.

Unfortunately I live in Ohio and our liquor laws here are asinine and I don't think there's any way I can have either of those shipped to me.  The one good thing about our weird state is there's an excellent website ([ohlq.com](https://ohlq.com)) that will allow you to search the current inventory of every liquor store in the state for specific bottles.  Which is how I know neither of those rums are currently available here.

I can see in the list of available rums in OH there are a lot... but I also know that price isn't a great indicator of quality in rums so I feel like I'm just shooting in the dark trying to choose them.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for rums I should try that are similar since I really enjoyed those.

Thanks in advance!",13,2021-10-06 01:31:11

I am looking to buy a nice bottle of Rum for my Uncles 60th.

I have little experience in rum but I have been doing a little bit of research. 

This is what he has previously drunk:

-Lambs spiced Rum
-Pussers Gunpowder Proof
-Bumbu 
-Bumbu XO
-Sailor Jerry

The above list is not exhaustive, it is just what I have seen him drink previously.


I have been looking at getting him the following:

-Ron Zacapa XO
-Ron Zacapa 23
-Ron Diplomatico
-Boukman Rhum

Looking at what he has previously drunk it looks to be that he favours spiced rum.


What are your recommendations? I am open to any.

* How do column stills work? Like, really, on the nuts and bolts level.

* Wooden stills, what parts are wood, and how does their functioning differ from metal stills?

I love the old school label, but I‚Äôve also been confused by the label saying it contains ‚Äúselect grape wines,‚Äù so I started to wonder if it was actually a brandy.  But a quick check of their website shows an update bottle and that it is a rum.  Still very confused about the label and the grapes.

Aside from the neat story, for me this was so so.  I was reluctant to finish the bottle for nostalgic reasons, but finally finished it off.  I also still have a flask size left.

The rum is a little dark and tastes sweet.  I tasted some vanilla and banana.  A little too watery for me, but some bite and burn.  I should have tried this in a cocktail.

I'm in Kansas City Missouri for a work event with my boss, my boss' counterpart in Louisville and their boss. They were looking for a good bourbon spot in downtown, so I did some Google fu and found a place called Oak and Steel, which reviews promised an excellent bourbon selection. Obviously the Louisville manager is a bit hard to please with bourbon, but he seemed pretty happy. I found on the last page of their whiskey list, they a had a small selection of fine rums, and they had every Foursquare release available. In fact, they had the 2008 half price as part of their whiskey Wednesday promotion ( the owner just got the 2009 and figured he'd celebrate by playing fast and loose with the concept) At 120 proof it had a nice burn, but a richness that was hard to describe. A full compliment of chocolate, coconut and banana, followed by a nice oakey spice note. Neat it was sublime, and it opened up nicely when poured over a piece of ice.

What I like: I dig vanilla caramel banana molasses funky pineapple tropical  flavors

What I don't: smoky, whisky replacers. 

What I've tried that I like: my so far favorite of all is brugal extra viejo. Diplimatico reserve ex is great, bumbu was great in my mixers but I know it's additive loaded, zaccapa 23 was good but didn't love for price, plantation pineapple was just ok, I liked some of the notes in zaya but overall not great

Blue_Fletcher,phgkca,1,rum,Thai Basil infused Rum to make a play on words - The Mai Thai,"I‚Äôve always been a fan of using ‚Äúsavory‚Äù ingredients and spices in baking and definitely in cocktails as well. I ran into this guy‚Äôs account who used a play on words for inspiration for this twist on a Mai Tai. They incorporated lychee and Thai Basil and the drink looks delicious.

1 1/2 oz. Plantation White Rum 3/4 oz. Cointreau 3/4 oz Lychee syrup (use the syrup from a can of Lychee) 1/2 oz. Lime juice 1 oz. Thai Basil infused rum (recipe below) 1 ea. Lime Slice 1 ea. Thai Basil Sprig

1.	‚Å†Grab a couple of ice shakers and and fill one with ice. Look out for hairs!
2.	‚Å†Add Plantation Rum, Cointreau, lychee syrup, and lime juice.
3.	‚Å†SHAKE IT NICE AND GOOD
4.	‚Å†prepare a rocks glass with some more crushed ice and strain through a Spring strainer. Make sure to leave a smidgen of space between the liquid and the rim of the glass.
5.	‚Å†Carefully finish with a float of Thai Basil infused rum.
6.	‚Å†Garnish with a slime slice and some fresh Thai Basil.
7.	‚Å†Drink and repeat.

How to make the Thai Basil infused rum

16 oz of Plantation White Rum, chilled 1 Cup (packed) Fresh Thai Basil Leaves, picked

1.	‚Å†Bring a large pot with about a gallon of water to a rolling boil
2.	‚Å†Add a bunch of ice to a large bowl, fill with cold water, and have a fine mesh strainer ready
3.	‚Å†Drop your picked Thai Basil leaves in the boiling water and with a stir make sure all leaves are submerged.
4.	‚Å†Leave Thai Basil in the boiling water for NO LONGER THAN 20 seconds. Use the fine mesh strainer to fish them out and immediately submerge them in the ice water. Leave them in the mesh strainer for ease.
5.	‚Å†Remove from ice water and pat dry between towels or paper towels. Removing as much water as possible without beating them up too much.
6.	‚Å†Combine chilled Plantation Rum and blanched Thai Basil in a blender and blend on high for about 30 seconds until the rum is vibrant green.
7.	‚Å†Strain through a fine mesh strainer and refrigerate until needed",2,2021-09-04 07:42:28

Bournestorm,pi6w3u,1,rum,"Help Determining Next Bottles: El Dorado Lineup, Diplomatico, and Plantation","Hey all, will be in CA in the coming months and have some chances to get bottles for much cheaper and some that aren't available to me at all normally. Trying to decide which bottles are worth picking up knowing full well I won't be able to restock on any for a while. 

Currently I'm big into tiki drinks and have my recipes mostly dialed in with rums I enjoy, and for sipping I lean toward Jamaican funky rums; home aged Wray &amp; Nephew is my favorite, but I enjoy Appleton Estate 12 as well and really like the overproof Hamilton Demerara. 

This is the first and only (For a while) chance I'll have to get anything El Dorado for close to a reasonable price, and I'm currently waffling on which (Or maybe all) to get. The 8 sounds like it could end up being fun to mess with blending into tiki drinks being apparently drier and cheap ($21), and the 12 and 15 seem ideal for sipping albeit on the sweet side. The 12 is $34 and the 15 is $50, so the difference in price is significant enough to give me pause. From what I have gleaned reading, the 15 is more complex and bit more spiced and less sweet, but I'd love to hear direct comparison thoughts from folks here. Ultimately, grabbing all three of these is tempting...

Was also considering grabbing a Diplomatico Exclusiva as I have a lack of ""sweet"" rums in my cabinet in general and I have enjoyed things in the vein as dessert rums and it might be nice to have something more approachable to offer guests.

Lastly, I was thinking of grabbing another Plantation offering as I've enjoyed the OFTD and 3 Star. Currently deciding between the Barbados Grand Reserve 5 Yr vs the Stiggin Pineapple.

Altogether, would love to hear some feedback on which of these may be most worth the time and money spent!",9,2021-09-05 13:05:37

The-Real-Bigbillyt,pjrljm,1,rum,Help me chose a second Foursquare ECS cask series to try,"I finally cracked my first bottle of Foursquare ECS 2008 and started drinking it the other day. It has taken me several tastings to try to figure it out. The nose is very hot, very alcohol forward, with notes of leather, tobacco, oak, baking spices, vanilla, caramel and cocoa. When I drink this I get many of those same notes plus hints of orange and additional spices, but by the middle of the flavor palette I am hit with an overwhelming flavor of chocolate which continues into the finish very strongly. I tried letting it rest for a bit, adding a few drops of water or a small ice cube, this opened it up a little bit to drop the heat and reveal a bit more oak on the backend, but it still tastes like a pretty heavy chocolate bomb for my palette.
I am very interested in trying another bottling of the ECS series but I'm not sure the best direction to go. I want to see if another variant is perhaps more balanced. I have access to Detent, Nobiliary, Empory, Redoubtable, Shibboleth and 2009. So, which one to try next? I don't have a huge budget for this so I would like to chose wisely.",5,2021-09-08 01:23:25

Their answer is that many are having a 75cl size, which is not the legal size in France which is 70cl. Might be the same in the whole Europe. Indeed, I see that Hamilton Black Pot Still is 75cl only. I myself never saw a 75cl bottle in Europe and did not even know this size exists, here it is 70cl. When I go to the Target website, I also see that 75cl seems like the legal size in US. I had no clue this would be the reason. So no hope to wait for such bottles anymore.

palmchill,pkfinc,1,rum,What are your unpopular opinions on rum?,"I love rum and this subreddit. However, I wonder if there is a touch of group-think. What opinions do you have that are contrary to the consensuses? For me:

1. Bacardi is a DECENT mixer. Yes, I know there is some added sugar and that it is  made industrially. A lot of industrial-made rums receive praise here. Would I sip it straight? Hell no! Would I drink a Bacardi and Coke with a lime? Hell yes!

2. Probitas is great. I love it. Is it a go to ‚Äúwhite rum‚Äù for something like daiquiris or mojitos? Not for me! I think Probitas has a wonderful and unique profile, but I don‚Äôt see it as a substitute for white puerto rican rums or similar. Despite what I read here, I don‚Äôt think it shines in a daiquiri at all. 

3. The Clairins Distributed by la maison and velier are wild and amazing. I have not tried the Sonson but I have tried the other four. How can people compare casimer, sajous ans vaval to le rocher? To me, le rocher tastes totally different than the other three. Maybe i am overwhelmed by the ham/prime rib note but to me, the le rocher is very different. I love the other three but le rocher is a little bizarre to me. Also, if you like it wild and strong, daquiris with the other three are so good!   

4. The Appleton Estate 12-year rare casks is very very good for the price. As far as mai thais, how about half this and half an aged agricole (e.g., Clement XO)? Why would you mix this with a funky Jamaican rum for a mai thai? This is coming from someone who  loves Jamaican funk. Also, the 12-year rare casks is great in a daquri. 

5. I think Dr Bird, Smith and Cross and others are a lot tastier than the Hampden Single Estates... I am not big on the leather, glue, dust and cherry notes in the latter

I snagged a few new bottles for my birthday, which has come around again quickly. My father asked what rum I wanted and after much deliberation, I picked the Tamosi. I do have the Tamosi Port Cask which is one of my favourite bottles, so that definitely swayed my choice a little. 

My father-in-law snagged me the Plantation barbados 5 year old. Not a bad choice since he chose it off his own back. I've been meaning to pick this one up for a while now.

The Tamosi is very unusual and has a lot of flavours going on - I found it really hard to pinpoint the taste accurately. My first impressions are:

Nose: When I first opened the bottle, it had a quality that really reminded me of a tequila. After a day or so, that seems to have gone. The nose is sweet, tart red fruit (cherry?), maybe a little toffee, vanilla and some baking spice. Old bourbon barrel is definitely noticeable.

Taste: There is a lot going on here. On the initial sip, the mouthfeel feels quite thin. It is quite a dry rum but it builds for a few seconds to a sweetness right on the periphery that fades as quickly as it came. There is a milk chocolate note, a small amount of brown sugar and a nuttiness that reminds me a little of Pumpkin Head 23. Bourbon oak again makes an appearance with a savoury note and fades to a slight bitterness. There is a little coconut too, although muted in the background somewhere.

Aftertaste: The aftertaste isn't very pronounced compared to a cask strength rum for example. I do get a creaminess, the nut characteristic is present again and maybe some slight cola on the finish.

I definitely need to give this one a bit more time; so many unusual flavours going on. It is definitely a pleasant sipper and not really like anything else in my cabinet.

I've also tried the Plantation barbados 5 year old a couple of times since I've had it and it just reminds me of rum and raisin ice cream; strong on the vanilla, strong on the raisin and very sweet. Very easy drinking. I don't have many sweet rums at the moment and I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I don't think the bottle will last for long! :)  I'll add a few more descriptors when I get to grips with it a bit more.",0,2021-08-03 15:45:31
Hendeith,ox0oon,1,rum,What rum for special occasion?,"Hey guys! In past months rum became my preferred alcohol, I have few bottles I can without hesitation call good (Veritas/Probitas, Foursquare 2004, Plantation XO) however now I'm looking for something truly special. You see next month (hopefully!) I'm getting my awaited promotion at my company. Big day for me since this is something I worked hard to achieve for past 2 years.

What I want to do is get some nice rum and drink it with my close friends. I don't want to spend any crazy amount of money, I think ~ $100 budget is fine. Would you be able to recommend anything? One thing as my requirements is that it should be available in Europe :/ I have no way of importing it from outside of Europe at all. Actually you can just give me best recommendations you have and I will check what's available.

Also side question, I saw some people smoke the glass with cigar before puring rum. Does it make sense to do so with expensive rum? (Of course assuming I would use quality cigar)",21,2021-08-03 18:32:45

That said when I jumped into rum I started buying bottles that were more on very highly reviewed side such as Foursquare ecs, Hampden overproof, worthy park, and some habitation velier bottlings.  Then I thought why not try a clarin and I went for Clarin sajous.  This proved to be a little bit too much for me as an intro to this style of rum.   For my taste buds it was a little bit too strong on the nose with the earthy tones.

HamMcFly,ogkybs,1,rum,Elevated Rum &amp; Coke,"Hello all, I am mostly a novice drinker, so please bear with me. 

My daily is a Barcardi Gold rum &amp; diet. I recognize Gold is a low-ish end bottle, and that much of the flavor is superficial, but dammit it tastes good and it‚Äôs cheap. 

I would however, like to find a nicer bottle for vacations and family events. I have always considered Flor de Ca√±a 7 my ‚Äúelevated‚Äù bottle, but both my FIL and I have noticed a change in the taste in the last few years. I know they were involved in a legal matter over the representation of aging, not sure if anything else has changed. 

I have tried quite a few alternatives, but nothing has the same exotic taste I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm sure this ‚Äúexotic‚Äù taste is simply my own mind games since I first had Flor de Ca√±a in Costa Rica and it has sentimental value, but I thought it was worth asking public opinion. 

For note, here is what I‚Äôve tried most recently:

Doorly‚Äôs 12 - very nice but goes better neat than mixed. 

Havana Club - likely where I‚Äôm leaning as of now. 

Largo Bay - the coconut is good for mixing (I even use it in homemade ice cream), but the regular is not. 

Meyers - this is the best I can get out and about at restaurants near me. It‚Äôs good, but just not what I‚Äôm looking for. 

Deadhead - honestly I bought this on impulse because the bottle is so awesome. Not terrible, but meh. 

Kraken - no. 

Jonah‚Äôs Curse - also no. 

Sailor Jerry - still no. 

Captain Morgan - very much no. 

There are probably more I can‚Äôt think of, but essentially I‚Äôm looking for a suggestion to evaluate a rum &amp; coke with something that sits comfortably between Bacardi Gold and something that should just be shipped neat. 

Budget is around $30-40 for a 750ml. 

I really appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you guys in this community.

For this weekend, I got real RUM and compared it to the other two. 

Definitely, DIPLOMATICO is better!

It is smoother than others. It has a better aroma. 

NOT Comparable with those two cheap bottles for sure.

Everything is good for the first few shots, it's really enjoyable.

After that probably I would stick with those cheap ones.

Hi, I'm a complete beginner in the rum world. I have tasted a few and I really liked them and I wanted to buy something that's not too sweet so I bought this one. I read a few reviews on it and they said it has some coconut and fruit notes, but I mostly just get just the oaky, smokey flavor of it. I've noticed that it usually disappears after leaving it in a glass for like half an hour, but I'm not sure whether that's ""allowed"". For some reason this rum tastes like whiskey more than like a rum, except for the tail, the tail always has a little hint of coconut and fruit. Plus it feels really sharp on the tongue (the burst of alcohol and smokiness reminded me of Jack Daniels in the first glass I drank).  
Can anybody here comment on that and tell me if there's any way to reduce the sharp taste in it? I read quite a few reviews on that rum but almost none of them mentioned the smokiness and I don't know whether it's acceptable to let it ""breathe"" for a while after I pour it in a glass. Thanks for the answers and cheers! (Btw I drank it on ice every time and it helped a bit, but not that much.)",4,2021-07-11 05:14:20

However, the TECC was confirmed to be good by a lot of people without feeling like your taste buds were actively fighting a zombified panther in a fruit market. Do I play it safe, or take the risk for an infamous bottle?",6,2021-06-02 06:06:27

This year I would like to try something different! This year I am going to splurge and double my budget from last year. Reason for this is I would like to look at grabbing two different bottles this year.

So my top price is $200 combined. I reside in Washington state, and really just want to try more and if possible want spiced and smooth. There was a clear difference in the Zacapa compared to the cheaper stuff and want to continue that love.

ArcanineNumber9,nur79i,1,rum,Chicago Rum Cooperative - Startup Distillery Looking for Community Help!,"Hello all!

I find self-promotion on Reddit to be somewhat in bad taste, but I'm humbling myself today because we need all the help we can get and this rum community is very tight-knit and supportive.

My name is Daniel Regueira. I've been working with some folks for several years here in Chicago to get a worker-cooperative rum distillery started. I'm extremely excited (and nervous!) that we're getting closer to formally starting in our space.

The concept behind the Chicago Rum Cooperative is to create a worker-owned rum distillery that is a local mainstay in the community. We aim to become **\*the\*** Chicago rum company and will thoroughly *‚Äúown local''* by focusing on the Chicago market. We will be a vocal advocate for worker-ownership throughout the city as well as equity for disenfranchised people. We focus on transparency, sustainability, equity, and community. Chicago Rum Coop is a temporary name. The other two got shot down for legal reasons.

Folks throughout the rum community like Will Hoekenga (American Rum Report &amp; Rum Cast), Karen Hoskin (Montanya), Andrew Lohfeld (Roulaison), Maggie Campbell (Privateer), and many more have been super helpful guiding us throughout the years.

Today, I want to reach out to the broader community for a big ask. 

We've started negotiating a lease for our location and are trying to move into initial fundraising as quickly as possible. To that end, we've created this Google Form to start collecting information from friends, family, and now the broader community on who would be willing to invest in our venture.

We come to you, fellow rum fanatics, for help. We're trying to get as many individual investors as we possibly can in this first round. If you're at all interested then check out the link below. And if you know anyone whos you think might be a rum fan, a craft spirits fan, a worker-ownership or coop fan, a fan of Chicago small-businesses, or a fan of this project otherwise, then please do us the huge favor of sending them this appeal!

I'm eternally grateful to all of you for the help! Feel free to reach out as well!

[Google Form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8kUtO-WyHmp95vMJQ4uR8HHBg3aZwR-ptuhdNdBY8ysYX8g/viewform?usp=sf_link)",12,2021-06-08 07:53:19

This may be a more niche post, but I wanted to get the word out there for anyone else stuck working around Utah‚Äôs liquor laws. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs illegal to ship alcohol into the state, and the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control runs the distribution of all liquor across the state. This is where our discord server comes in. 

The state does have a special order program, the largest hurdle here being that products can only be ordered in case quantities. Luckily Utah law does allow for groups to place special orders together, so long as the product is distributed between the group at cost. A discord server has been setup to abate the task of finding people interested in the same products. We have channels setup to coordinate orders and express interest in products you‚Äôd like to special order. The server is small at the moment, but we have successfully ordered both Smith &amp; Cross and Amaro Nonino, with a new order that was just placed for a case of Cl√©ment VSOP Agricole Rhum Vieux.

I‚Äôve had absolutely no training so I‚Äôm taking it apon myself to teach myself so I can give customers the best advice when I need to. 

I‚Äôve been enjoying trying different spirits, Ive fallen in love with courvoisier, but now I‚Äôm moving onto rum. Hence why I‚Äôm here.

Without breaking the bank too much I‚Äôve narrowed it down to two id like to try which are both on sale. Drury 173 spiced rum or Red Leg spiced rum.

I like to drink my spirits on the rocks but I can‚Äôt decide which to pick. Any advice as to which is more flavourful or better in your opinion,is one miles better than the other or are they about the same in terms of quality?

My buddy is getting married. We have a tradition of going to a rum bar on the first of the month.  We‚Äôve done so much rum tasting over the years at a certain tiki bar in the Bay Area that I never want to see another punch card again in my life ;)

I was going to get him a bottle of rum fire ( it‚Äôs the first rum we drank together) and some vintage tiki mugs but he found a bottle of rum fire at the store this week.

So now I have to do a 180 and get him a really nice bottle instead of a ‚Äújoke bottle‚Äù.

I‚Äôm in the SF Bay Area and have about a $150 budget.


I‚Äôm thinking:
 Zafra Master Series 30 yo
Something from Foursquare
Samaroli Jamaican rhapsody

I understand that taste is subjective but would love any feedback or help acquiring a nice bottle of rum (or a few more vintage tiki mugs if anyone knows where to get them besides eBay)

Kamwind,nw59t8,2,rum,Papa's Pilar and what they mean by solera.,"yesterday there was a post about Papa's pilar ""23 solera profile"" dark rum, and people not being able to understand it.  So I wrote off to them asking for their difference between ""solera profile"" and regular solera rum. 

Below is their response.  Nice and quick customer response back.

\----

 

Thanks for reaching out! Great question and we can definitely assist.

The 'Solera Profile' comes from how we blend our rum, we solera blend using a proprietary process. Solera is a fractional blending process first developed in Portugal and Spain for Port and Sherry. We employ¬†a proprietary solera system for Papa's Pilar that contains rums sourced from multiple countries.¬†¬†

The numbers on the front of our bottle represent the solera taste profile in our artisanal blend. It mentions this on the back of the bottle. Our Papa‚Äôs Pilar Blonde Rum is a blend of 5 rums, the rum blend includes rum aged up to 7-years old. Our Papa‚Äôs Pilar Dark Rum is a blend of 7 rums, the rum blend includes rum aged up to 24 years old. The label on the side of each bottle showcases where the rum blends are sourced from in relation to countries of origin.  


Both our Dark and Blonde rums pass through American Oak Bourbon barrels. The Dark then enters Port Barrels. They both then spend time in Oloroso Spanish Sherry casks. The Sherry Finished Rum then goes back into fresh Oloroso Sherry casks for a concentrated time. ¬†

Our Solera is not time based, thus there is no set amount of time for the rum in each layer. It depends on the reaction from the wood and the previous occupant of the barrel, therefore it‚Äôs up to the rum makers to decide when the rum has the correct amount of flavor before moving to the next level down.¬†  


Hope this answers your question and helps!

ProfessionalSuch5825,nw5ewo,1,rum,Incredibly Rare Rum [valuation],"Dear Rum Community members

Firstly I would like to sincerely apologies if anyone is offended from the following post.

Legend has it that this was the very first bottle that had been produced and is the only remaining unopened and undamaged bottle on earth.

The owner of the bottle, allegedly said to a Doctor whilst he was taking his last breaths from a ventilator; ‚ÄúLook after black-head‚Äù. 

This story went 60 years without ever being understood, it was a mystery and was something that simply passed by. 

Last year the bottle was found whilst a property developer was renovating the property. 

The mans last remaining family member was given the bottle of rum and instantly 60 years flashed before her eyes before she said; ‚Äúblack-head‚Äù and died with the bottle in her hand. 

Now the bottle sits inside a tissue paper shoe box.

Would anyone know the value of such a disgusting and satanic cured rum bottle?

If it was the last remaining bottle, could it be worth a tremendous amount of money to the correct individual? 

What if the original owner knew something about the powers of the bottle?

If anyone could kindly allow me to upload images of the bottle I would be tremendously grateful. 

It deserved to be seen by the world.",7,2021-06-10 04:24:32

jspartan00,n3etko,1,rum,Trying to remember the name of a brand,"Ok so about a year and a half ago I moved into this new apartment with some of my friends and the previous tenants had left an unopened bottle of white rum. We were excited to discover this and celebrated moving in with some drinks.

However, this was the worst rum we'd ever had in our lives. It literally tasted and smelled like drinking paint thinner and was so strong it couldn't even be mixed with anything to numb it down. It had a yellow label and some pirate theming and i'm fairly certain it was bottom shelf. 

Anyways, I've looked around trying to find the brand again and I can't find it anywhere. It wasn't Captain Morgan, and I don't think it was Wray and Nephew. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I'm trying to buy another bottle as a parting gift when we all move out this July. Thanks for the help!",6,2021-05-03 04:11:00

I also like transparency in terms of age.

Sugar: Zero or close to zero sugar regulations.

That's it

Blue4thewin,n6i6xw,1,rum,Five Years of (Bordering on Compulsive) Rum Buying,"I started collecting rums about five years ago and I've amassed an ample the collections so far. I thought I would share with you all my thoughts on some of my favorites, and maybe get some input on some rums I've overlooked, or receive any suggestions for new cocktails to make.  

Highlights:

1. Foursquare ECS D√©tente (honestly the entire Foursquare line could take up a whole list, but this one is my favorite at the moment) - best rum I've ever had, would highly suggest for anyone who enjoys a smooth sipping rum
2. Smith &amp; Cross/Rum Fire - really enjoy both of these funky, over-proof Jamaican rums. I'll typically split the base of any cocktail I make with both of these 50-50. 
3. Oddball of the bunch - New Grove Savoir Faire - picked this Mauritian rum up in Paris the week before France went into the first COVID lockdown and thankfully brought it safely home to the US. It has an interesting menthol-like flavor from the wood they use to barrel age it. It is definitely not for everyone, but it is certainly unique. 
4. Favorite Daiquiri rums - Flor de Cana Extra Seco (not pictured because I ran out), Probitas, or Diplomatico Planas split with La Favorite Rhum Agricole blanc-  I love a classic daiquiri - I use the Cocktail Codex recipe calling for  2 oz rum, 1oz. lime, .75 oz cane sugar simple syrup (1:1). The lime is upped to balance the higher proof rums (except Flor de Cana, which is 40%). I also like to play around with substituting key limes in lieu of Mexican/Persian limes.

I know my collection is a little deficient in some of the single barrel and long-aged Jamaican rums (e.g. Hampden), but unfortunately, there is limited distribution in my state.

Hope you enjoy! Cheers!",0,2021-05-07 05:27:42

I'm looking for something that I can get my hands on relatively easily (without having to pay international shipping fees) that is really special and unique. 

I know Caronis have a bit reputation but people seem to be kind of split on whether they're actually worth the money or not considering the polarizing taste (I have never tasted one before). I'm also not sure where to find one.

RizemEQ,mim40q,1,rum,Recommendations please?,"Hey,  


I'm pretty new to good rum and wondered if anyone had some suggestions of where to head next. I'm in the UK. Budget wise, price not really a factor up to ¬£50 or so, ¬£100+ would have to be special but I doubt I'd appreciate those yet anyway.  


I had the standard journey, liked spiced rum and coke, moved up to Kraken then started exploring sipping. With coke I enjoy Kraken and Black magic enough to request them, but don't mind the usuals, Sailor Jerry, Capt Morgan,   


My fave so far is Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva. I enjoy the rum, but I also enjoy the aesthetic, the look of the bottle, more importantly the texture, the sound and feel and fit of the cork. I pop a large sphere or cube ice block in a tumbler with maybe a triple shot or so, drink it over an hour or so enjoying it most in the middle once cooled with a little melting. It's a bit too strong at first but I finish it well before the ice more than half melts or it's too watered down.  


I really like the Appleton Estate 12 year, maybe as much as the Diplomatico but the experience isn't as enjoyable, the bottle looks nice but using it it's just a standard spirits bottle.  


I really didn't enjoy the El Dorado 15 Year Old Special Reserve. I persevered with it hoping I'd learn to appreciate it but I just didn't. It wasn't just not worth the money to me, I actively didn't enjoy sipping it.  


I've tried a couple of supermarket bottles, a cheaper Mount Gay, Cut to the Spice, Cut to the Smoke, Dark Matter. They all taste too ""cheap"" or simplistic to enjoy drinking neat.   


I was happy just trying out all the expensive aged rums assuming I'd like them all and explore preferences, but I was really surprised to dislike the ¬£50 El Dorado so much! I'd appreciate some suggestions or pointers on understanding and differences etc :)",26,2021-04-02 23:01:04

I have used both Plantation Isle of Fiji (don't want to waste the good stuff on weekly cocktails) and Holmes Cay SC 2004 (special occasions) to make rum &amp; tonics, smugglers cove Hurricanes, and also traditional Mai Tais. In all cases that i have tried blending these rums with others for these two types of cocktails, the glue, pine, and smoke notes have DOMINATED the other rums in the blend- even those with higher ester counts and ABV like Smith &amp; Cross or Hampden OP. I stopped blending with my Fiji rums because of it (still love them), but I'm curious if it's just a personal thing or if there is something about the funkier Fiji rum notes that just doesn't play well with others?

Tylerkillzya,mj1gk1,1,rum,Beginner's thoughts on a few rums,"Hey all! I made a post a few weeks ago talking about my prior experience with rum and what my mindset should be when trying different kinds. I had originally bought Plantation XO 20th Aniversary Edition and not enjoyed it the first two go-rounds so I passed it off to a neighbor. This time, I purchased some other highly recommended rums with the intention of sticking to them and trying them on a more consistent basis. So, that's exactly what I've been doing. I started with trying the Diplomatico Reserva Exlucisva and all I can say is that I've drained that bottle extremely quick. After trying it a few times (with and without ice) I finally could taste the sweetness people had been talking about. It was as smooth as others had mentioned and I loved it. But, it did take a few times of tasting it for me to finally enjoy it. Next, I tried the Dorado 12 which I did find slightly sweeter, but for me, I also felt a slight burn, and overall I felt more strongly towards the Diplomatica. Tonight, I went for the Appleton 12 yr and enjoyed it, as well. Although, it hasn't grown on me completely like the others have so at the moment the Diplomatica is still my favorite. Anyways, all of this was to say that sometimes it takes a couple of tries for people to begin experiencing the flavors and that if someone doesn't enjoy a glass of rum their first go around, wait it out and try it a few nights later again and you may have different feelings towards it. If anybody has some other drinks they recommend that would expand my palette a little further I wouldn't mind taking a look. Have a good weekend all!

alseick,mk6r8q,2,rum,"Looking for recommendation - like Doorly's, Chairman's Forgotten Casks","Hi  
**TLDR:**  
I am looking for something which is similiar to:  
**Doorly's 12, 14**   
**Chairman's Forgotten Casks**  
Tested similiar: Doorly's XO(quite good), Doorly's  8 (one dimensional, paper taste), Foursquare Detente (didnt like earthiness), Foursquare 2008 is just OK for me, because I smell acetone), Mount Gay XO - could be darker, its like sweet chocolate, nice &amp; gone too fast, Hechicera - too 'bright', Chairman's Legacy - too herbal and smooth, Chairman's  2005 - also has herbal note which bothers me, otherwise it is very good,

Trying to not exceed Doorly's 14 or Foursquare 2008 price.

**Blabla, longer section:**  
After tasting a lot of rums it seems I like these the best, but I would like to explore a little bit more.   
I definitely like darker, chocolate-raisin-woody notes.

What I liked the most:  
**Forgotten Casks** \- I like it a lot as it is like dark chocolate yet non bitter and woody for me, but lacks flavour (could be stronger).  
**Doorly's 14** \- I find this the best, smells like XO and 12 blend, though expensive  
**Doorly's 12** \- I like it a lot, but it could be darker, stronger  
**HMS Princessa** \- actually sometimes I like it better than Forgotten Casks as it has more flavour. A little bit too sweet.  


**Quite good:**  
**Doorly's XO** \- quite good, but there is some weird bitterness. Maybe it is sherry finish, I noticed I can't stand rums like Maderos 5+5 or Abuelo 7due to wine-earthy notes, but on the other hand I can stand Cartavio 12 and I actually like Flor De Cana 12. Less flavour than 12 imo.  
**Foursquare 2008** \- after a while it becomes better, and with a coke I actually prefer it to Doorly's 14, but my nose picks acetone  
**Mount Gay XO (new version, triple cask)** \- too sweet, not much wood, dissapears quickly 

**Not my cup of tea:**  
**Doorly's 8 -** this is weird, for me it tastes like essence of Doorly's 12, like somebody wanted to clearly show the main note of 12 and extracted it and only it - one dimensional, smells a little bit like paper. I even prefer Doorly's 5.  
**Foursquare Detente** \- earthy, dark notes, though I like the fact that it is missing that strong acetone smell which I am picking in 2008  
**Chairman's Reserve 2005** \- wow that has a lot of flavour. I actually almost liked it, but there is some herbal part whcih I dont like it slightly reminds me Mexican Mint or Cuban Oregano (oleus amboinicus). I can't get that out of my head now. Strong but no acetone note at all.  
**Chairman's Legacy** \- honey &amp; herbs, actually a lot of flavour for that price, but too herbal, too 'bright'  
**Chairman's Edition for some european shop** \-  John Dore 1 i Vendome 2012, too much herb, weird fruits - its like upgraded Legacy.  
**Mount Gay Black Barrel** \- not much of flavour, a bit alcoholic  


**My wishlist based on the above:**  
HMS Formidable  
HMS Royal Oak  
Chairman's 1931- **did anybody compare this to Forgotten Casks?** I wonder if it has same herbal or weird fruit note as Legacy.  
R.L Seale 10  
English Harbour 5 or English Harbour Madeira - as I Doorly's is supposedly Madeira  
I might try also Worthy Park as I got such recommendation as I also like a bit funk

**Wishlist- others:**  
Mezan Xo Jamaica,   
Blackwell Fine,   
La Maison Venezuela (or some other),  
Plantation Dark Original,   
Quorhum (a lot of people recommended this, but I am afraid it will be like a lot of Rons - which I find watery),   
Wood's old navy (hope it wont be like pussers, looking for OFTD)

  
**So far liked:**  
Appleton 12 Rare, Plantation OFTD, so I can stand slight funk, Smith&amp;Cross is a bit too much, but still tasty :) El dorado 12, Flor De cana 12, Plantation Pineapple, Brugal

**Didnt like:**  
wine-earthy  notes: Abuelo 7, Maderos 5+5, PLantation Guatemala &amp; Belize  
something too dark or bitter, smoky: Havana 7, Pusser Blue Navy, El Dorado 8,  
mild, lacking depth: Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, Plantation 5 Barbados, Plantation XO 20th anniversary (it is better than 5, but still pretty light to me), Doorly's 8

**Good, but not my cup of tea(weird)**: Barbancourt 8, Equiano (like old book, iso E super, Molecule 02), Blue Mauritius (more like spiced rum, I prefer more natural Plantation Pineapple),

As much as I would love to experience every sub-categories, my budget is limited and I want to slowly but steadily enter the world of rum.

Here are available options I have access to :
Smith &amp; Cross Navy Strength(52$)
Rum Sixty Six 12YO Cask Strength(50$)
Appleton Estate 12 (43$)
Rhum J.M. Agricole(40$)
Havana Club 7 (42$)

And other stuff such as Don Papa, Matusalem, Brugal, Dillon Rhum, Plantation, Diplomatico( enjoyed it quite a bit)

I would appreciate general advices too.

Simply I am looking for something close to Plantation Guatemala Xo, or at least - if you know - what is the main reason that it tastes like that? Is it the region,is it Amburana casks or what? I smell deep, non-sweet coconut.  That is awesome.

My goal here is to find something hopefully normally available, not limited edition. I am more into Bajan style rums I guess (chocolate, raisins, not super sweet), but I bought Peru and Guatemala Vintage Editions as I was curious, and when I tasted Guatemala XO for the first time I just was: wow thats unique.

I don't like Plantation 5YO Barbados or 20th Annniversary which probably have some slight notes of coconut - they are too mild, sweet to me. Guatemala XO, at least for my taste buds, is kind of deep. I am not a fan of earthy note which is also there but I  prefer that than having some one dimensional sweet rum.",2,2021-04-08 23:49:53

**42%ABV, 8 years in ex-bourbon, then 4 years in ex-cognac, sample from FD**

-----

**Highlights** - great fruity nose

**Lowlights** - not as easy-drinking as you'd expect from an 84pf pour - kind of alcohol-forward on the palate

**A Few Tasting Notes** - Dole fruit cup, honey, stone fruits (ripe apple, pear, peach)

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Doorly's 12, Plantation OFTD

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Pusser's Blue Label, Mount Gay Black Barrel

**Overall/Thoughts** - It's ok, but thoroughly unimpressive.   Nose is solid, palate is ok, finish is ehhh.  I like sipping this neat better than most Jamaican rums but against its non-funky brethren, it doesn't stand out or make me want to revisit it.  Liked the 2004 Panama a lot more from Plantation. Would probably make a good base spirit in a mixed drink. **65/100**",0,2021-04-09 11:22:58

I'll be (hopefully) moving into a a new home by end of year, so I'm doing some, um.. ""spring cleaning"" and clearing out a bunch of samples and bottles I've got sitting around - this is the penultimate pour from a bottle I've had for a while.

-----

**Highlights** - almost already tastes like like a cocktail - very sippable neat

**Lowlights** - this is so egregiously perfumey and saccharine on the nose.   It's not necessarily a bad smell.. it's just *pungent*

**A Few Tasting Notes** - pineapple (obviously), a ton of butterscotch, vanilla bean, orange rind 

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - RL Seale's 10yr, Plantation OFTD

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Rum Fire, Diplomatico Reserva

**Overall/Thoughts** - This would be a great flask pour on the beach, but it's hard to really judge it as a rum given the pineapple infusion - it feels like it's already a mixed drink.  It's very sweet, very pineapple-y, but it's balanced well on the back-end/on the finish with some baking spice/peppery notes.   I'd say this is best served in a mixed drink, though you'd probably want to lay off the simple syrup a little.  Not bad, but since I'm not a mixer/tiki guy (and since I don't live on the beach!), I don't have much use for this.  **64/100**",1,2021-04-09 12:04:38

First is, do you have strong feelings about being strict about the type of rums that go into a particular bottle (Jamaican only, or rhum agricole exclusively), or is it fun sometimes to take risks and put whatever strikes your fancy in?

**55.4%ABV, 3yr 4mo rum aged in ex-rye**

Hey, don't know anything about this other that that spec line.  Privateer has a history of being thoroughly average for me, but here I am again with yet another of their samples, so they're clearly doing something interesting.

------------

**Highlights** - Lots of good things going on here, from the nose to the palate and finish, overall, it's strong.  Favorite part is the chocolately-malt note

**Lowlights** - No real gripes here, maybe a smidge brash on the nose but it's 4yr and 110 proof, what are you gonna expect

**A Few Tasting Notes** - chocolate malt, rye bread with cinnamon butter, cayenne; ""mexican hot chocolate""

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - XXX/Two and /Three 

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Rolling Fork Batch 2020B1, Ultimatum Panama 10yr

**Overall/Thoughts** - This is great.  It's got a ""Barbancourt 8 but spicier"" vibe going on.  So good I'm killing the sample in one go instead of the normal two.  I'm really surprised here since I'm not a huge Rye Guy, but this pairing nails it.  It's not the most complex or challenging pour, but it does a small handful of notes, and it does them pretty well.  Great job, Privateer.  **79/100**",1,2021-03-05 07:33:24

Over time I feel like I can get a handle on it, but I'd love to be able to speed up that process and be more confident in my tasting notes.  Do you have a process you use to taste a new rum?

Some specific questions to consider to get the conversation started:

* Do you use a reference rum(s) to compare the new rum against?  If so, how many and how do you select them?
* Do you taste alone or with people?
* Do you read the distiller/bottler's tasting notes before tasting?
* Do you dilute with water?  If so, do you use a standard ratio of rum:water or dilute to a target proof?  What do you use to control the dilution?
* Do you have favorite tasting glasses?

I had a throat infection a few days after. I got myself tested and did not have corona. Could this have been caused by this black substance? If yes, what is it? Did my expensive and favorite rum now because something to drain? Or can I still use a coffee filter to save this?

Why does this only happen to these three bottles but not to any other bottle in my collection? I have over 40 bottles, many of which still have something in it. Many of those other bottles are older than the Reddit ones.

So what exactly is this? And is this safe to drink?

odditykarl,m1oqoj,1,rum,New bottle of TCRL Fiji 2014 smells like straight ethanol,"Hey all, 

I bought a bottle of the transcontinental rum line Fiji 2014 and I just opened it. I'm usually a whiskey drinker but I've had about a half dozen rums before of varying qualities, though nothing from this line or distillery before. As far as I can tell this bottle was stored properly and I broke the seal, but the smell from the bottle and glass is just like pure ethanol, and it tastes how it smells. 

Is this how this bottle is? Did something go wrong with it? will it get better? I'm super bummed because I was really excited to try this fun rum and now I'm not even sure it's safe to drink. Thanks in advance",4,2021-03-10 11:55:10

Also if possible please write a price limit that you woud pay for it at max , i am in Hungary and some stuff have normal prices , but some utterly overpriced compared to how much it costs where it came from , so maybe for the prices i have here it woudnt worth it.",3,2021-03-15 04:28:01

I cracked this one open at the weekend to see what it was like. I have a bottle of the Diadem in the cupboard so was interested to see how they would fare side-by-side, both being of a similar finish. Some of these Foursquare releases do seem to settle with slightly different flavours after a few weeks so am wondering how it will mellow. I had a couple tastes over the weekend to try and get a bit of an understanding of the nuances.

Nose: Standard Foursquare (nail) varnish offering, zesty citrus (lime?)/red &amp; tropical fruit, Oak. Adding a few drops of water brings out more of the zesty fruit. Back by popular demand, my 4 year old daughter's thoughts of the nose: dirty smelly fruit! :D

Taste: The initial entry is sweet (fruit), which almost immediately transitions to the oak characteristic. Red fruits are detectable in a similar vein to the port finish (probably from the madeira cask) but it is definitely not as prominent. There is some muted brown sugar in the background but this one isn't as sweet as the 2008. The oak is quite strong and bitter and there is a definite black pepper note that is quite forward.

What immediate strikes me about this rum is the spiciness (think chili heat) - wow, my tongue is on fire, even with some extra added drops of water.

Aftertaste: Relatively short lived for a Foursquare offering - the spicy burn on my tongue lasts for a while though! :) Black pepper on the finish with dry oak and a tiny bit of the madeira influence. The Redoutable (currently) is very astringent and drying in my mouth. I did find that when I initially opened the 2008, I had the same issue but the effect did dissipate after a while - I'm wondering if the Redoutable will do the same. This rum is less sweet than most of the other recent offerings.

Diadem (aged for 12 years bourbon/madeira) vs. Redoutable: (aged for 14 years bourbon/madeira): With the spicy afterburn of the Redoutable still fresh in my mouth (added drops of water in the Redoutable to tame it) I poured a small measure of the Diadem from the bottle. Bearing in mind that the Diadem is 60%, drinking it straight actually 'cooled' my mouth down from the Redoutable.

The Diadem and Redoutable main body flavours are very similar given that they are both bourbon/madeira aged; I would suggest that the 'highlights' are what differ somewhat. Compared to the Redoutable, the Diadem is more mellow and has more of an orange with a bit of dark chocolate, whereas the Redoutable is a spicy (hot) black pepper oak.

The flavour of the Redoutable wasn't really what I had expected, especially that spiciness. I'm interested to see if the flavours change as I get more used to it and now that the bottle is open.",0,2021-03-15 17:28:41

I like the merchant and have used them before so I intend to roll the dice on it and if it‚Äôs levied at 20% of the total then fair enough but has anyone in the UK actually been impacted by this yet? If so how much was the fee and was there a big delay in getting it sorted?

RockTheJungle,la6jaw,6,rum,Disappointed with Flor de Ca√±a 12 years,"A while back I got myself this bottle of Flor de Ca√±a 12 years. I'd been curious about trying out an aged rum, and it was discounted to ¬£25 instead of ¬£35, so I really couldn't help myself.

So my palate isn't the most developed, I'm really not a rum tasting expert, but I've been occasionally drinking it for months thinking I'd get used to it and I just don't enjoy it. It tastes very bland to me. Barely any flavor, the tiniest bit of sweetness, then the rest tastes and feels like pure ethanol, thinned down with water. Pretty bad burn on the way down, more than most similar spirits I've had neat.

Then I found out that a couple of years back there was a call to boycott Flor de Ca√±a over some supposedly very harsh working conditions. Now I've not kept up to date with this and I don't know if what was reported back then is still true, but that didn't help with my opinion of the brand.

So, now I've got a little over half a bottle left. Definitely not drinking it straight. It's alright for a rum old fashioned. I'd feel kinda bad about mixing a 12 year old spirit with coke or ginger ale. Maybe a cocktail like a daiquiri or a painkiller could work?

Am I the only one who's had that kind of experience with it? Are the other Flor de Ca√±a rums worth checking out? Are there similar rums to this one I shouldn't bother with if I didn't enjoy FdC 12?",36,2021-02-02 00:03:24

RolfTheCharming,laa29v,2,rum,"New to ""unadultered"" rum, I loved MGXO, where to branch out from here?","Hi r/rum! This sub made me aware of the fact that some of the rums I thought were so amazing (specifically Don Papa and Zacapa 23) had added sugar and sometimes even added flavorings. That's not necessarily a deal breaker for me, I still enjoy these drinks, but I was curious for a taste of rum without those additives, so I went for the Mount Gay XO that's often recommended here. And I loved it. I got lots of fruity notes (definitely some overripe banana in there) as well as oak and, surprisingly, a quite noticeable amount of vanilla. It basically had all the notes and ""smoothness"" I liked from the sweetened rums, but somehow more natural (for lack of a better word) and drier in a pleasant way. The alcoholic beverages I drink the most aside from rum are unpeated (or very lightly peated) single malt scotch, red wine and gin. So the flavors I enjoy most are spice (cinnamon/cardamom/cloves), oak, red fruit, herbs and citrus zest. A hint of smoke is pleasant too. My partner likes sweeter caramel and vanilla notes. What could we try next? Something that's similar in flavor profile but maybe a bit higher in complexity? I did find that the MGXO was *almost* more exciting in the nose than on the palate, and it is mostly oak-driven, which is not a bad thing, but I'd like to explore a flavor profile that's maybe a touch more varied.  Availability shouldn't be too much of an issue where I live. I've gone over the most popular recommendations on here and have already made a note of them, but I'd like to hear which ones are a good ""next step"" from MGXO (that also don't contain added sugar).",2,2021-02-02 02:22:49

Do you want to avoid the numerous traps and pitfalls inherent in your average liquor store‚Äôs sugar- and additive-laden rum shelf? Do you want your answer to that perennial, ‚ÄúHow did I do?‚Äù question to be, ‚Äúabsolutely fantastic, you beautiful person?‚Äù Do you want to sip the finest in sugarcane spirits from your crystalline goblet while nestled in that lovely candlelit bubble bath that I know you‚Äôre planning on taking tonight? Well, you‚Äôve come to the right place, hun. 

Anyway, because some of the picks and omissions herein are likely to be controversial, I feel the need to add a few disclaimers before we proceed:

**1) These recommendations represent my opinions ONLY,** and they are NOT, nor should they be construed to be, representative of the views of the r/rum community or mod team as a whole.

**2) These recommendations center around standard bottles that are readily available off the shelf.** If I delved into the likes of one-offs and limited releases, then not only would the list be much longer, but it would also leave the average newbie frustrated as hell that they‚Äôre not able to find half of the bottles in question anywhere.

**3) These recommendations center around AFFORDABLE bottles.** Generally speaking, that means $50 or less, with only a minority of bottles breaking that mark.

**4) I don‚Äôt differentiate between ‚Äúsippers‚Äù and ‚Äúmixers.‚Äù** Generally speaking, anything that I‚Äôd use in a cocktail, I‚Äôd also sip from a nosing glass in a pinch, and vice versa. Good rum is good rum, even if some good rum might be better than others.

**5) The prices referenced are rough estimates as to where the bottle should be ideally priced.** If you see the bottle in question marked above the maximum referenced amount, then you might want to think twice about snagging it and grab something else instead.

**6) These recommendations are centered around the United States market.** If you live in the Eurozone, well, bloody good for you. Go buy any one, or several, or all, of the bajillions of affordable distillery and independent bottlings that remain out of reach for those of us in the Colonies, thank you very much three-tier system.

**7) No, I will not add Plantation rums back to the list. No, not even OFTD.** And I'm tired of rehashing the arguments as to why. As a result, any further comments regarding why there are no Plantation rums on the list will be responded to with random facts about birds.

That said, if you still have any questions, concerns or complaints regarding the selections or omissions below, please feel free to send a private message my complaints department manager, u/stormstatic. He absolutely adores reading drawn-out dissertations on why Zacapa 23 is the holy nectar of the gods, so please be sure to make your arguments as detailed and lengthy as possible, complete with citations.",166,2021-02-03 07:36:31

Long story short , I got a 3 liter barrel as a gift over the holidays and want to attempt to mimic [Barrell's Dovetail blend](https://www.barrellbourbon.com/dovetail).  I'm hoping you can help me determine the best rum to use. If it works out, I'll have 3L of wine-aged rum as a part of this process. What rum would you love to taste with a touch of wine aging?

Barrell lists ""**black strap molasses casks""** as what they use for Dovetail. With that in mind, I was thinking Myers, Goslings, Kraken. I've also been considering Wray and Nephew, but that'd be like $100 for 3L. 

Here's my barreling plan if you're interested: Wine (3/4 Australian Shiraz, 1/4 random red laying around) for 10-14 days &gt; Rum (idk which) for 10-14 days &gt; Ancient Age 90 or WT10 for 30-60 days

I'm no professional and as such have **very low expectations**. If what comes out at each swap (oaked wine, wined rum, wine-rummed bourbon) is drinkable, it's a success!",4,2021-02-04 01:42:52

Heading to Barbados? Don't go now, but take note for your future trip. This post includes info about distilleries, stores, and restaurants.

**Distilleries**

MOUNT GAY ([https://www.mountgayrum.com/tour-mount-gay/](https://www.mountgayrum.com/tour-mount-gay/)**)**

The distillery is in the north part of the island but they have a tasting room in Bridgetown. The staff is amazing and it is worth doing to premium tasting (\~12 rums) at the tasting room in addition to the distillery tour - on separate days. You won't end up drinking much at the distillery (*at least we didn't*).

The staff is amazing and it appears to be a humble operation despite the worldwide distribution and Remy Martin parent company. They were transparent about adding coloring to the regular releases to promote visual consistency but that is not done to their special one-off releases. The current/new master blender is a local woman in her 30s who apprenticed under the previous master blender.

*Buying rum?* There is more for sale at the tasting room but the distillery might have some more unique products. Cash only at the distillery. Credit is accepted at the tasting room.

FOURSQUARE

About 10 minutes from the airport in the southern part of the island. It feels a bit like Disneyland. Super impressive and massive operation. Great group of people working there. Not sure what it is like during non-pandemic times, but there were parking spots for tour buses. The tasting afterwards was very casual and educational. Don't miss it!

*Buying rum?* Credit accepted. Unfortunately the selection was bare. There were a few ECS bottles that could easily be found in the US.

ST. NICHOLAS ABBEY

Beautiful piece of property near Mount Gay. The train ride is a bit cheesy but quite educational. There wasn't much going on at the distillery. It was more of a self-guided tour with a few signs. Certain times of year they crush sugar cane which visitors can observe. The owner poured rum samples for us in the house - they will engrave purchased bottles with any message you'd like. Older batches were produced by Foursquare; maybe 15+ year old which are pricey.

*Buying rum?* Credit accepted. They are expensive and we were only able to sample a few.

WEST INDIES RUM DISTILLERY

This is where Plantation is made. Rumor has it they are working on opening it up for tours.

**Local stores**

There are multiple WINE WORLD locations with decent selections. We got a cool looking Plantation tasting set for like $80 US (tasting it was not that fun). You won't find much Foursquare ECS but you'll see Doorly's and their other brands like Old Brigand. Grocery stores like Massy have good selections as well.

AIRPORT shops - these have decent selections. But don't bank on it. If you want something from Mount Gay you can find it but the Foursquare selection likely changes often. When we went to board they plane they asked us to fit our duty free stuff into our carry on bags; that was more of a formality.. just stuff it in and then remove it once you are on the plane ;) 

**Restaurants**

The main one you need to check out is Tapas (see above photo) as they have a whole menu for Foursquare: [https://www.tapasbarbados.com/DM1/RM/MENUBROWSER.ASP](https://www.tapasbarbados.com/DM1/RM/MENUBROWSER.ASP)

Their food is good too. It's a classy joint with a great view. The cocktails aren't bad either.

Wherever you go, scope out the bar. We found a 2015 Foursquare bottle at the Atlantis hotel restaurant. I'm sure other older bottles are hiding out at random spots.

**Rum bars**

Barbados is full of little rum bars which are mostly for locals. This is an economical option if you're not into the touristy spots (which can be expensive). These bars sell little bottles of rum along with beer and most things you'd expect to find at a dive bar. You'll also get a bowl of ice and bottle of water. We liked John Moore Bar which is north on the west coast - it's more of a shack but the vibe is great. We found some old mini bottles of Mount Gay Mauby which hasn't been produced since 2015.

Some of these spots have good food too - check out the fish cutters (sandwiches).

**Misc. tips and tricks**

* Tap water in Barbados is great and safe to drink. Don't waste plastic or money on bottled water.
* ""Bajan"" is pronounced like ""Asian"" with a B in front of it.
* Try mauby - a drink made from bark. Try sorrel (hibiscus) drinks.
* Bring home local sugar so you can make your own Bajan Rum Punch. But don't bring sugar in your carry on bag - mine was taken by security for some reason. That said, I was able to buy some overpriced local sugar in the airport.
* You'll probably want to rent a car. Drive on the left and go with Stoutes Car Rental; we tried multiple agencies and they were by far the best.

*Enjoy your future trip to Barbados, it's an amazing country.*

I'm thinking getting a not-so-expensive bottle and just chucking a couple chillis in for a couple months. What are your experiences with similar things?

JohnCaddell,lcfo2r,41,rum,"So I learned what ""funk"" is last night.","I have been sampling the various styles of rum over the last few months to figure out what I enjoy most. I've tried plenty of Bajan, Agricole, Demerara, and a Venezuelan, but I was hesitant to dive into Jamaican. In trying to figure out what ""funk"" is, and whether or not I would like it, it became clear that it's one of those things you can only understand by tasting it. So, taste it I did.

When selecting my first Jamaican, I had a hard time picking out the right bottle. Appleton is popular, but apparently more woody than funky. Doctor Bird sounded good, but my local shop didn't have it. Wray &amp; Nephew Overproof received high marks, but I don't know if I can handle that for sipping. Same with Smith and Cross.

I have really enjoyed sipping on Probitas (or, Veritas) lately, which has some Hampden in its blend. The cheapest Hampden available to me was their 8-year (not overproof) at $60.00, but I figured it was worth a shot. I pulled the trigger and had my first glass. Here are my thoughts:

It's weird. It is indeed funky. Some have compared funkiness to overripe bananas, but that didn't come through as much for me on this tasting. Some reviews I read said this rum has notes of ""burnt rubber"" and ""glue,"" which seemed silly, yet, they were right! There is this chemical sort of flavor reminiscent of some pungent non-food items. There were some milder fruity notes, but for a first taste the esters were overwhelming.

I'll admit, it was hard to enjoy. I really wanted to enjoy it. I could tell that it was an excellent rum in the Jamaican tradition. What do you think? Was this a bad starting point for Jamaican rum? Will I learn to like it? How would you mix this, if at all?

As in the title, turning 30 next week and looking to treat myself to a nice bottle, maybe something I wouldn't normally buy but not crazy money either!

Usual go to Rum for me is either the kirk and sweeney stuff if drinking neat and kraken if i'm having mixed rum. Bought a Don Papa recently and enjoyed that but found it was a bit rougher compared to the kirk and sweeney one.

Tried quite a few rums over the years and i'd definitely say my tastes tend to go towards either spiced or more of an aged rum. Not overly fond of white rum(except in cocktails) or really heavy/dark rum.

Would be drinking it neat, maybe on the rocks or with a splash of water, hope that helps and i can expand my rum cabinet!",9,2021-02-09 00:27:32

I started loving rum,  not because of this sub but because of a book.

That book,  being a cocktail book called ‚ÄúJulep‚Äù from a bargain out outlet store (ollies).  The book is great,  seriously a 5 star cocktail book.

Either way a number of recipes called for a spirit ‚ÄúEl Dorado 5 year‚Äù.  I thought ‚Äú5 year..... yikes,  sounds expensive....‚Äù 

When I finally came across El Dorado 5 year at like 20.99 usd.  I thought ‚Äúgreat! Cheap decent rum!‚Äù 

This rum made me LOVE RUM! Holy hell.  I became obsessed,  Appleton signature,  then Appleton 12 (whatever I could find locally).

Then for my Birthday I traveled out of state to grab El Dorado 15 at a Total Wine.  Perfect 100 from me.  Probably one of the best spirits I have tasted per my preference.

The  this sub came around and was talking about about some navy strength rum that is some what of unicorn.  

I researched,  saw it locally and picked it up.

THE FUNK. I LOVE IT.

Disclaimer;  I do not drink straight,  But with Demerara sugar, fresh lime juice and a large ice cube.

Gharma,kp6grw,1,rum,How to Tip-Toe Back into Jamaican Rum?,"A few years back I had a bad experience with Appleton 12. It was absolutely delicious, and I loved the slightly funky notes, but maybe I enjoyed it too much one night and since then the thought of it turns stomach. I really miss that funk though, and especially for use in cocktails (though having a nice sipper would be great too), I would love to make the effort to find out how to love Jamaican rum again. Does anyone have any ideas on some good bottles for me to dip my toes back into those funky Jamaican waters? Do I try something light or go for a funk bomb like Smith and Cross? Maybe something identifiably Jamaican but different enough from Appleton to not trigger any memories? I one day hope to get back to enjoying Appleton and similar rums, but I think I've got a long road ahead of me.

Before posting I did see some old posts about intro Jamaican/funk, but I figured my particular situation was different enough to try a new post. If it's not, sorry, I'll be happy to take it down.

Utsutsumujuru,kpsgo7,1,rum,Does anyone else notice that they have trends in preference for specific age range?,"So a recent comment on one of my reviews made me realize something. Looking at my reviews for over 60 rums it seems I have a clear preference for rums aged 12-15 Years and also minimally aged rums aged 0-5 years. It seems my nose and palate doesn‚Äôt seem to like rums aged 5-10 years. 

I am not a sugar Puritan (though I do object to non-natural additives beyond sugar), but I generally don‚Äôt like sugar-loaded rums as much*. I also generally don‚Äôt like Solera rums as much (Centenario 20 is the only Solera that I have ranked in my top 15).

In fact looking at my 15 highest rated rums I get the following breakdown:

7 are rums that were aged 12-15 years (medium-old aging)
5 are rums that were aged 0-5 years (minimal - or no aging)
3 are rums aged past 20 years (1 is a Solera so it is probably more in the 12-15 age) (advanced aging)
0 are rums aged 6-11 years (medium)

I have no conscious bias with specific aging in rums (it‚Äôs not like I won‚Äôt try 6-11 year aged rums). I seems to be that the amount of oak that goes into rums between 6-11 years adds something that doesn‚Äôt agree with my palate, maybe. The one 30 year aged rum I have had (Zafra 30 year) I noted as very pleasant and nice but not truly exceptional to me. It made the top-15 but not my top-5...the mature oak taste seemed to overwhelm everything else. 

Here are my personal top-15 favorite rums:

1. Foursquare ECS 2007 (12 Year)
2. Zafra 21 Year
3. Barbancourt 15 Year
4. Transcontinental Rum Line Fiji 2014 (4 Years)
5. Doorly‚Äôs 12 Year
6. Plantation XO (12-15 Years on average)
7. Panama Pacific 15 Year 
8. Zafra 30 Year
9. Appleton 12 Year Rare Casks
10. Smith &amp; Cross (up to 3 Years)
11. Hamilton 151 (up to 5 years)
12. Clement Premiere Canne (&gt;1 year)
13. Selvarey White (blend of 3 and 5 year rums)
14. El Dorado 15 Year
15. Ron Centenario 20 Solera (12-15 years on average, who knows?)

I grabbed my Plantation XO, which I bought around the same time as the ED21, and now I can really REALLY notice the sugar.

BUSHMONSTER31,kq7upv,1,rum,The addiction grows! :D,"Well, the rum stocks are certainly looking a lot healthier after Christmas (although my liver may not be!). I even have a Bourbon to mix things up a little. The only one I've not tried yet is the Admiral Rodney No. 1 finished in port barrels.

I did get a sample of the Hampden Estate Rum (46%) which, as you can imagine definitely has a Jamaican funk to it. I do like my rums generally on the sweeter side, but I have to say, I wasn't a fan. To me, it tasted sour, grassy and of damp wood. There wasn't much body to it and the flavour didn't last long. The aftertaste wasn't too bad; very woody/spicy with a funky bitter pineapple. Way too dry for me.

As you can see, I do have a bottle of the Worthy Park (which is way less funky) and although finished in Wine barrels, the taste is much more robust and more pleasant. Also, I don't find Appleton anywhere near that sour/funky either...

I do have several plantation bottles I've tried besides the XO(OFT, 5 year Barbados, Xaymaca, and one of their peru vintages) but overall they aren't my favorites.

rebellemon2441,ktbka7,1,rum,So I listened to your advice ‚Äì time for me to tell you about my experience.,"About a month ago I posted on /r/rum because I really couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of the entire world of rum, and was considering sampling a lot of plantations. I have been drinking whisky for 20 years, but was recently introduced to the world of good rum by a Dutch independent bottler (the Duchess).  So you guys gave me advice, and I am now the slightly embarrassed owner of around 20 bottles of rum. So I did a couple of comparative tastings, and wanted to let you know what my findings are. Bear in mind I am a total novice. Feel free to correct me, disagree with me, or provide me with more advice. Your input was awesome last time, so I trust any comments on this post to be similarly welcoming. 


**First group: Barbados**

1)	Plantation XO: Bought before I posted, and I didn‚Äôt appreciate it much. Very sweet, lots of coconut, orange, no balance. The spice was alright though. Arbitrary score: 6,5/10

2)	Mount Gay XO: Much, much better, it actually feels like it has wood character like a very good whisky. I get cinnamon and mocha, with fudge and prunes. It is a lot better than the plantation. 8,5/10

3)	Mount Gay 19 yo The Duchess: really different from the XO. Much drier, apples, citrus and vanilla dominate, with almonds and a slightly bitter finish. I like the XO better. 8/10

4)	Foursquare 2007: fruity/spicy. Strawberries, orange, ginger and a little pepper. Very well balanced and layered. Evolution in the glass. 9/10

5)	Doorly 12. Bought because it is also Foursquare but less than half the price. But completely different. A lot of caramel, with chocolate and apricot. Remins me of Werther‚Äôs. 7,5/10

Concluding: Despite their price, cask strength Foursquare still might be my favourite value for money


**Second Group: Jamaica**

6)	Plantation Xaymaca: Nice rum, combining aniseed and orange. Not complex. Not bad 7,5/10

7)	Plantation Clarendon 17 yo: The reason I thought Plantation was a brilliant company. Still love it, nice balance of fruit flavors (citrus, banana bread), with spice like vanilla and clove. 9/10

8)	Wray and Nephew. White rum. By far the best white rum I have ever tasted. It has notes of brown sugar, apple, even some banana in the back. It still doesn‚Äôt compare to the others, for lack of complexity, but it‚Äôs good and interesting. I‚Äôm happy you guys told me about this. No score.

9)	Appleton 12. Good, but light. Peach, hazelnuts and mint. Nice balance between fruit and wood character. Still I need more. 8/10

10)	Goslings Black Seal  (not Jamaica I know). Very unique. Preposterous ABV, but watered down it‚Äôs not any good. Gingerbread, liquorice root, dutch butter cake. Very unique. Nice experience 7,5/10

Concluding: I am fascinated by Jamaican rum. Would like to try more. I am unsure whether I managed to buy any truly funky rum. Am now contemplating Smith and Cross, Monymusk CS, Rum fire, and Appleton Signature. 


**Third Group: Spanish style rum**

11)	Brugal 1888: Not as sweet as I was expecting. Buttery, blackberries, vanilla and nutmeg. Nice spice. 8/10

12)	El dorado 8: Tropical fruit, mango, pistachio, sugar candy. It‚Äôs very fruity, changes in the glass with air, and I appreciate it a lot. 8,5/10

13)	Angostura 1919: Well, that‚Äôs not good. An odd amalgamation of different sweet flavours with a flowery bouquet. Cr√®me Brulee? Much too sweet. Why did I buy this again? 6/10

14)	Diplomatico Mantuano. I risky bet, cause the reserve exclusive my mate let me taste was dreadful. But this is much better, I get coffee, cherries, figs. It‚Äôs sweet, but not overly so. Also somewhat to light for my tastes. 7,5/10

Conclusion: Spanish style rum is risky. These guys love their sugar. I should find some cask strength versions. And what exactly defines demerara is not apparent to me from the El Dorado. 


**Fourth group: French style/ Agricole**

15)	Clement VSOP: Very light rum, grassy flavour, vanilla, parsley. Like lowlands whisky. 7,5/10

16)	The Duchess Ten Cane 11yo: Trinidad, but still Agricole. Like it a lot. Cane sugar like cachaca, honey and grapes, slightly peppery. 9/10

17)	 The Duchess Rhumerie du Simon 15 yo. Lighter on the cane sugar, strong vanilla, citrus fruit. Good, but not like the Ten cane 8/10

18)	The Duchess Bellevue 19 yo: might be French style, but not Agricole. Very fruity, some of the best spirit I have tasted in my life, including very expensive whiskies. It has oak character with nuts, berries and orange with spice and cinnamon. 9,5/10

Conclusion: I might not have gotten the concept straight. French rum does not equal Agricole. Getting Agricole in the Netherlands is actually pretty hard despite our proximity to France. So these were mostly IB‚Äôs, and I am unsure how well they represent the style. 


**Final thoughts**

All in all I consider rum a very enjoyable new hobby. And oh boy are these rums cheap when you are used to whisky. That Appleton sells for 27 euro, the Diplomatico Mantuano for 22 euro, El dorado 19,50 (probably the best value for money I have ever bought in any alcoholic beverage). Mount Gay XO 35 euro. 

I do feel I would probably appreciate many of these rums better as sippers at higher ABV‚Äôs. If you guys have any more advice for me based on my ramblings, let me know.",20,2021-01-09 04:55:34

Ninjakillzu,k6q0v9,1,rum,Turned off of Clairin,"I recently picked up a bottle of Saint Benevolence Clairin, and opened it because I was so curious to try it and I've never had clairin before.

Now I am stuck with an almost full bottle of something I'm not sure I like. 

Now I am scared that if I buy anymore clairin, it'll be a waste of money. Are all of them super weird? Normally I am a big fan of Jamaican rum, so I thought the clairin might not be too different, but this bottle was a shock to the system.",9,2020-12-05 02:02:35
rebellemon2441,k6s572,2,rum,Looking for some advice for a beginner: comparing regions,"Hi all, I'm from the Netherlands, and I have just recently discovered rum as a new and exciting alternative to the whisky I've been tasting for 20 years. So far I've bought bottles of Fourquare, which is awesome, Plantation XO 20th anniversary, which I find too sweet, and Plantation Jamaica 2005 which I loved. Also I tasted around 8 different IB's from the Duchess, a dutch independent bottler. 


So now I'm trying to figure out how to buy a lineup of bottles that will properly represent different regions/countries/islands. So far I think I would like to have a bottle from Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados, Guyana, Martinique/Guadeloupe and maybe Fiji, Panama, Haiti or Guatemala? What do you guys think?


Also, in my country availability is best for plantation rums. I could buy a line-up of there recent single casks, but their (amazingly detailed) website also says they add sugar (I did not like that overly sweet XO) and they have some pretty weird casks (whisky, peat, Aquavit, Champagne, you name it). Would plantation bottlings even be representative for the character of a region? Or do you guys have better ideas?


Finally: What are your favorite rum discords/forums? I have a bunch of detailed questions about distilleries, aging, finishes, volatile compound content, ester content etcetera.",36,2020-12-05 03:52:20

**46% ABV, 8 year (2008), DARSA distillery**

Not a whole lot I can find on this sample other than what's on the label.  It's no longer listed on FineDrams, so we'll just have to have forgo the preamble.

------

**Highlights** - very drinkable, if not a smidge on the sweet side.   Good depth of flavor in spite of the proof

**Lowlights** - not a ton of personality here, but not a ton to complain about.  While it has depth of flavor, there's no width/breadth.

**A Few Tasting Notes** - dried coconut shavings, brown sugar, it's very soft and sweet - think Zacapa 23 without the extra 17 pounds of added sugar

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - RL Seale's 10yr, Mount Gay Black Barrel

**Pours I've Like a Little Less** - Pusser's Blue Label, Diplomatico Reserva

**Overall/Thoughts** - It's not bad, but wholly unimpressive.   I could drink this as a daily driver without much complaint, though it is a little sweet for my preferences.  I think if you like Zacapa, you might like this even more, or might be able to use this to segue into other non-dosed rums.  I like it, but it's pretty one-note.  **64/100**",0,2020-12-07 06:18:07

It_is_too_early,ka6z2f,1,rum,"Bourbon drinker, rum curious.","Something you probably hear quite a bit, but help me find a rum. It would be fun to try something new, explore a whole new territory where I know nothing and be blown away with it‚Äôs offerings.

I‚Äôve been in the whiskey game for years. Not a huge fan of Canadian, Irish is alright, ryes can be really good or forgettable, scotch is impressive, but bourbon is my favorite.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get a lot of crap for this but the rums I‚Äôve had an enjoyed most are Captain Morgan 100 proof like a delicious fluffy sponge cake and Cruzan 137 proof tastes like creme cheese icing.

Maybe it‚Äôs because of bottle in bond bourbon and cask strength releases, but those are the stuff I‚Äôve had an enjoyed.

But they are very one note (around $20 that‚Äôs obvious) I‚Äôm sure there are more complex and delicious rums out there and figured I‚Äôd ask those passionate about them.

Average rums to me, The citrus and apple cannonballs, really cool bottle design, alright booze, fair price. Ron Diaz, drinkable but not my kind of sweet, more like a soda sweet.

Rums I‚Äôve not been thrilled about, Castillo‚Äôs gold (still nightmares from that party) Bacardi silver, and most flavored rums. Alright for getting drunk, nothing I‚Äôd ever drink again unless offered.

Basically consider me a complete novice with no experience in rum.

Bourbons I really enjoy if it helps, Old Forester 1920, Eagle Rare, Orphan Barrel Rhetoric, and Weller Full Proof.

Notes of rich apples, caramel, honey, toasted golden brown marshmallows, and dark chocolate are my favorite.

Budget is pretty loose, anything $20-80. Live in Mid Michigan but work lets me travel to Illinois and Wisconsin every once in a while. (Pre-covid at least) And If I‚Äôm completely missing the point of what rum is, and should be, I‚Äôll gladly listen to the more experienced in what I‚Äôm misunderstanding.

(Also I proofread this, but full disclaimer, pretty intoxicated, so apologies if this wound up unintelligible)",13,2020-12-10 10:54:01

anonmarmot,jnjnq3,1,rum,Review #59 - Damoiseau VSOP,"[This](https://i.imgur.com/YW9dsU2.jpg) is a self styled agricole Vieux style rum from Guadeloupe bottled at 42% going for around $50/750ml and was sent to me as a sample from a generous redditor. I've had a bit of a mixed bag trying out agricole style rums but the Vieux/aged ones have been mostly favorable. Let's see how this is!

You really can smell this from across the table it is pungent with fruity esters, candied plum comes to mind. This smells awfully sweet for my prior experiences with agricoles like a sweet fruit syrup. Definitely some orange peel and vanilla on the nose as well. A bit earthy but not much. I'd peg this as a Vieux in a blind I think, but it doesn't retain a ton of that fresh/grassy thing. It really drinks between like a 8/10 year old Bacardi (fruity/citrus column still) and the agricole vieuxs I've tried.

Fruit and citrus in equal measure and not nearly as sweet as the nose suggested. Surprisingly more citrus than fruit in the finish and a bit of warmth but this isn't hot. What a weird rum. I wouldn't run out for a backup of the same bottle but I wouldn't be mad I bought it. It's nice, interesting, a bit weird with the style confusion to me at least, and an easy drinker. I love the warmth on it and just how much citrus I'm getting. I'd say it's priced well. It's not my favorite style so that may bias me against it a bit but I do think it's a bit above average.

Wastasquare,jpt9ye,1,rum,A lockdown review #1 - Daily sipper contest,"Hello Redditer,

Throughout the past year, I've started a more serious rum journey, and this reddit has been a decent part of it. As you could assume, the lock-down gives sometimes a bit of extra free time. And working in hospitality and having a lock-down gives an extra bit of ""too much free time"". I always appreciated rum reviews, and found that this subreddit can offer some lovely one. Much more than any Facebook group that is merely people showing off bottles with no interesting info or tasting.

After reading so much here, and sometimes commenting, I thought that I could do a bit more during the new month-ish lock down that UK is having, by getting my recent tasting review written. Nothing fancy, nothing truly pro, but something worthy to add to the subreddit I hope.

Here I am having a go at some of my first bottles ever bought. Contestants will be :

**Zacapa Xo**. I bought that one for ¬£85 on sale. I thought I would enjoy it. Never been disappointed that much by a bottle I think. Got beaten blind by a ¬£24 doorly's xo. Since then I refuse to get involved with zacapa.  
*Main info I have from it is that it is kind of the zacapa 23 aged further years in cognac barrels. Minimum age seems to be 6 years, hence an XO. But still a Solera system, so not that old overall? Aged in ""high altitude and made with virgin sugar cane honey"". Seemed fancy at first... But truly it's a way to say ""we use cane syrup like the french guys, and we are on high altitude so our angel share is lower in the end."" It uses additive in any sorts, caramel colorant and sugar.*  
Isn't it a lovely looking bottle? Actually wait... is that gross plastic painted gold? The closer you get, the cheaper it looks.  
**Glass and nose:** caramel like color. Sweet nose, soft tones. Not aggressive and a tiny bit of complexity. Hint of fall in here, sweaty wood and mid-dry fallen leaves. Then the cognac makes it entrance, dried prunes and figs with some roasted spicy wood. It doesn't smell ""fresh"", but it is quite alright.  
**Mouth**: Nutty? Sweet but pleasant. Dries out quickly than the entry makes you think thanks to a good waves of tannin. The prunes are still here. Medium finish, silky and liquor-ish.  


**Rhum JM xo**  
*What is now my go-to. Tiny bit expensive compared to a Teresa or Doorly's 12, but nonetheless so great. I bought it after realizing how different an aged agricole was (I had an eye-opening taste of Clement VSOP). I had the white 50% JM at work, quite special, So I went for this xo.*  
*Here is a classic french xo agricole. 45%, cane syrup on a colonne savalle. 6yo minimum. Bourbon cask.*

The **nose** is less sweet, it seems younger and at first more aggressive. Past it, the bourbon cask is giving a lot. Behind it comes some herbal notes, not unlike the white version though less grassy. a tamed JM then, but spicier than the Zacapa, more complex, and fresh on the nose.  
Not too strong on the **palate**, a good deal of wood. Quite dry with much less tanin than Z. It would be an ok rum if it wasn't for the finish. This is glorious, the green papaya, fresh vanilla, tiny spices, cardamom like, and a never-ending delicious mango, staying in the back of your tong and taste bud like it's gonna start to live there.  


**Santa Teresa 1796.**   
*My ron of choice back in the day. Bought one bottle and got drunk quite quickly, since I offered it a lot to guests, and brought it back to my workplace as after shift drink.*   
*I like the fact that they don't bullsh\*t you. It is solera aged, but no weird number on the label. No sugar, or really a little. And decently priced. Also, massively distributed.*  
**Nose**: Sweet and soft like a Zacapa, a tiny bit bland to be honest, not fresh, not strong, but a decent one. It smells toasted like a good ron usually smells to me.  
The mouth is also soft, not too sweet, light and easy. To be honest, I am still tasting my JM xo through the santa teresa... wrong order for the rum tasting eh. A bit of caramel, hint of spiced through the alcohol, and then gone. I've had many rum since I first tasted that one, and now it is not as good as I thought it would be. I will still be happy with it though. It does what we are asking for. Easygoing and inoffensive.

**Doorly's 12.**  
*Foursquare, needs little introduction. I had a full doorly's xo before that, which was my real gateway rum, and bought the 12 not so long after. I absolutely loved it at first. Still likes it but it can seem a tad light to me now.*  
*We have a 12 year old rum, 10% madeira cask, 90% bourbon cask. No sugar added.*  
**Nose**: ""Rummy"" smell. Later Foursquare smell would become my standard in ""oh, that smells like rum no?"". The madeira cask and pot still content are noticeable. Especially after a santa teresa. Strong and flavorfull nose that can matches JM XO. Difficult to put word on it, but I decided to qualify that as fruit and spiced biscuit. Like Speculos if you are familiar with it. It smells fresh and pleasant.  
Easy on the **palate**, sweet entrance with tropical fruits, and then fully dry onto a good medium finish.

Conclusion :

If I were to sort them, it would look a bit like JM xo &gt;= Doorly's 12 &gt; Santa Teresa &gt; Zacapa xo.  
If I were to add notes, I would give them       14/20 &gt;=     13.5/20    &gt;     12.5/20      &gt;    11/20  
None are truly bad in my opinion. 

* The Zacapa Xo is way too expensive for what it can offers so I would advise people to not bother about it. My flatmate (whom I thank for the picture) kept hearing me every time I was trying it ""damn ! So disappointing!). I gave my best try to this bottle. But most of it went through dark and stormy.
* I will always have a JM xo, or vintage, open in my house. It has become a real pleasure and favorite.
* Santa Teresa is alright. It does the job and I use it a lot in cocktail actually. It is a rum to offer to non-rum drinker, or as a gateway rum in my opinion.
* Doorly's 12 is also quite alright. Less tasty than a JM xo, but also a totally different rum, way cheaper, and maybe more widely available. Hence quite close in my rating. It is a great classic anyway.

BrianRampage,jqkxge,1,rum,Rum Review #35/36 (Network #234/235) - P√®re Labat 40 and 59 Rhum Blanc,"**Rum Review #35/36 (Network #234/235) - P√®re Labat 40 and 59 Rhums Blanc**

P√®re Labat is a product of the Distillerie Poisson (Fish distillery?) on the island of Marie-Galante, which is (consults Google) an island territory of Guadelupe in the Caribbean.  There's documentation of Columbus visiting this island on second voyage across, and the island was known for its windmill-powered sugarcane production throughout most of the 1800s - which obviously eventually lent itself to rhum agricole.  After a long stint of slave labor on the island, Distillerie Poisson has been striving to provide fair wages and benefits to their staff. Good for them! Interesting stuff.  

-------

**P√®re Labat 40**

**80 proof, unaged agricole from Marie-Galante, ~$20, from a sample**

**Highlights** - honeysuckle, wet grass, and orange pith nose

**Lowlights** - super thin on the palate, there's some minerality-like notes that cut the sweetness too much, ""sweaty socks"" on the nose

**A Few Tasting Notes** - cardamom, simple syrup, a smidge of hogo, vanilla oat milk

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Doorly's XO, Rhum Barbancourt 4yr

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Ron Zacapa 23, Rolling Fork Small Batch

**Overall/Thoughts** - This is fine, if not too watery.  This new make's flavors just don't hold up to the cut proof.   It's not unenjoyable by any means, but I think this is best used for tiki drinks instead of neat.  **55/100**

**P√®re Labat 59**

**118 proof, unaged agricole from Marie-Galante, $30, from a sample**

**Highlights** - this has a nice, clean profile progression - sweet, savory/grassy, then toasty and a little spicy on the finish

**Lowlights** - it's a little wild on the nose - industrial cleaner (bleach),

**A Few Tasting Notes** - light hogo, that honey wheat brown bread you get at Cheesecake factory, coconut, pepper

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Mount Gay Black Barrel, Smith &amp; Cross Traditional, Probitas/Veritas White 

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Clement VSOP, Rum Fire, Stolen Overproof

**Overall/Thoughts** - There we go, much better at cask(ish?) proof.  Like the 40 and most other ester-driven r(h)ums, this is also *probably* better served in some upscale tiki drinks (don't ask for suggestions, I'm a cocktail/tiki noob, sorry!), though it delivers enough to think about neat.  I dig it; it's at a good price/good value if you have access to it. **64/100**

Utsutsumujuru,jqmg6y,1,rum,I am loving Selvarey White,"So I got a bottle of Selvarey white a while back and posted a review of it here. I have been drinking on it for a while now and I have to say, I really like it. It has become easily my favorite white/clear Spanish style rum. None others really come close and I generally do not like white rum in general, though I do like some white Agricoles. Selvarey is different though from other Spanish style white rums I have had..mainly in that it doesn‚Äôt taste like something you should pour in your gas tank. I think the difference is that its actually a blend of aged rums that has been filtered. What I particularly love about it is it‚Äôs versatility. You can easily drink it straight up and it is indeed primarily a sipping rum. But it is also absolutely amazing in cocktails. Seriously, if you haven‚Äôt tried it go pick up a bottle. It will pleasantly surprise you.",6,2020-11-09 07:46:56

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a longtime scotch nerd, but Rum has quickly become my favorite spirit, or at least currently, as we all go through phases. 

But I am a real purist, and rums that add sugar offend me. To each their own, for sure, and some of them taste nice, but I can't get past it. I deeply appreciate how folks like the Fatrumpirate offer up their hydrometer tests, and wish resources like that were available for spirits like Brandy, which I also love, but don't trust.

Is there any advocacy being done to get the rum industry as a whole to at least let it be known up front if they add sugar? 

I know most folks don't care, but I also know some of us care deeply, especially considering how many folks these days also try and keep their carbs down.",23,2020-11-10 08:44:43

I'm continuing through these fun, oddball samples from P√®re Labat.  After mixed results from their unaged blancs, I'm moving on to their moderately-aged Reserve Familiale (6yr) and Extra Vieux Hors d'Age (8yr).   Aged agricoles are one of my favorite styles of r(h)um, so I've got high hopes on these.

-----------------

**P√®re Labat Reserve Familiale**

**42% ABV, 6 year rhum agricole from Marie-Galante, Guadeloupe, ~$70, from a sample**

**Highlights** - A nice little woody/spicy/grassy finish for a 84 proofer

**Lowlights** - the wild cleaner/bleach note from the full proof blanc hides in the nose behind a little hogo-ish funk; perfume fights with peppery oak on the palate

**A Few Tasting Notes** - bleach, floral perfume, toasted oak

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Rolling Fork Small Batch, Plantation Original Dark

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Novo Fogo Silver, Novo Fogo Gold

**Overall/Thoughts** - I'm torn on this one.  It's weird, which is generally the good thing about agricoles, but I can't get away from the prevalent perfume note.  It's a palate-killer, and though I give it points for uniqueness, I can't say I'm really enjoying this one that much. **49/100**


--------------------

**P√®re Labat Extra Vieux Hors d'Age**

**42% ABV, 8 year rhum agricole from Marie-Galante, Guadeloupe, ~$120, from a sample**

**Highlights** - incredibly fruity on the nose and palate, almost cognac-like

**Lowlights** - almost too sweet/fruit forward, loses almost all its grassy/green cane character

**A Few Tasting Notes** - grapes, Bazooka bubble gum, pepper

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Rhum JM VSOP, XXX/Six

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Clement XO, Privateer Distiller's Drawer #67, Ultimatum Jamaica-Demara Sherry Finish

**Overall/Thoughts** - OK, I like this one a lot more than the Reserve, though I probably couldn't drink more than a few ounces at a time before palate fatigue kicks in.  It's *very* fruit forward and sweet, with a good mouthfeel and decent finish for 42% ABV.  If I'm trying this blind, I'd be tempted to guess 'yak.  Whether that makes it a good rum or not... I'm not entirely sure?   There's not a ton of info on their specific barreling/aging that I can find, but it almost feels like the difference between tired ex-bourbon barrel (reserve) and a wet ex-cognac (this).. though I assume they're both ex-bourbon.  How do you score a rum masquerading as a cognac?  Give it a **74/100**, that's how.",0,2020-11-10 11:13:10

Being a fan of rum with port finishes, when I saw this listed a while back, it really piqued my interest. I'm a port fan so combining rum and port - what more needs to be said!? I've been looking for a cask strength port finish, and had been thinking about importing the worthy park port finish from europe, but decided to hold out for this.  I've found the recent releases of Diadem and 2008 stunning to say the least; I just hope this one lives up to expectations. (I'll no doubt be purchasing another bottle of the 2008 very soon as you can tell from the picture.)

I'll put up my thoughts tomorrow - I just hope it's as good as it sounds: ""Jammy aromas of ripe plums, blackcurrants and loganberries are joined by ginger, rosemary, sultanas and maple syrup on the nose. The palate offers notes of raspberry jam, fruitcake, sticky dates and walnuts that linger in the finish alongside black pepper and smoky black tea.""",14,2020-11-12 23:48:28

BrianRampage,jtawhs,1,rum,Review #39 (Network #238) - Privateer Queen's Share (P326),"**Review #39 (Network #238) - Privateer Queen's Share (P326)** 

Privateer's Queen Share is a single barrel expression, made by distilling multiple batches of collected ""seconds"" (specifically the ""tails"" - the end of the distillation where the alcohol starts getting bitter) an additional time to create a ""rich, dense"" product.   The pessimist in me would say that they're just recycling parts of the distillate that might not be used for anything else anyways but who knows.   All in all, Privateer usually puts out youngish and/or experimental stuff that's generally well-regarded (non-dosed, non-filtered), so hopefully this follows suit.

------------

**56.9% ABV, NAS (usually 2yr+), Barrel P326 - these go for about $45, I believe, each batch is matched to either a new American oak, ex-bourbon, ex-brandy, or ex-rum barrel, depending on the profile.  I unfortunately have none of this info, as I'm working with a sample here**

**Highlights** - solid nose here - dried coconut, a smidge of gasoline, walnut, wood shavings

**Lowlights** - super soft on the palate on entry, then violently ramps up in heat out of nowhere before calming down to a very sweet/dry vanilla creme finish

**A Few Tasting Notes** - more coconut, vanilla creme, tabasco sauce, brown sugar 

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Rhum Barbancourt 8, Smith &amp; Cross, 

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Doorly's 12, Pere Labat 59, Probitas

**Overall/Thoughts** - This unfortunately falls apart on the palate.  Something at 110+ ABV should have some stronger flavors here, and it just honestly doesn't.    Just.. weird, and out of balance, but decent despite its flaws..  **67/100**",1,2020-11-13 12:50:29

I found this really accessible (and enjoyable), and last week decided that I would work my way through some of the Foursquare brands/offerings.

Fast forward to this week, and a Doorly's 5 just arrived at my door. On a quick taste, this is great stuff! It seems to me that even at ¬£23-25 here in the UK, it represents very good value for a well-crafted spirit. The inquisitive part of me wanted to see what you guys stateside pay for this....and on a quick google of Totalwine.....HOLY FRIGGIN' HELL!! You get **1.75** litres of stuff of this quality for $22.99!! That's just insane. And here was me feeling bad for you guys with the whisky tariffs you are suffering through....fuhgeddaboutit!

Conceptually, these recommendations could start with [influential rums](http://thelonecaner.com/key-rums-of-the-world/), [popular rums](https://rumratings.com/brands?order_by=&amp;letter=&amp;min_rating=&amp;search=&amp;rum_type=Aged&amp;location=&amp;company_id=), or even rum categories like those from Smuggler‚Äôs Cove or Minimalist Tiki. I know I‚Äôve personally followed the footsteps and recommendations of many on this sub, as well as other online resources like blogs and YouTube‚Äîthis could be an effective (and potentially entertaining) way of visualizing that roadmap for fellow enthusiasts.

ABananaDolphin,jb5ks0,1,rum,Review: Holmes Cay 2005 Guyana,"
About the Rum
Holmes Cay Guyana Port Mourant Demerara 2005 comes from a single cask of rum distilled on the famous Port Mourant double wooden pot still at Demerara Distillers in Guyana in 2005.  Aged for 15 years in the UK in recycled American oak rum casks.  Bottled by the independent bottler Holmes Cay in New York at cask strength (56.4% ABV) with no water, coloring, sugar, or flavors added. 180 bottles produced. 

Overall Assessment
For me, this rum is a 4- on a scale of 1 to 5 (see full explanation of rating system below for further context).  I enjoyed it, but am not going to rush out to acquire a full bottle. 

On the Nose
The nose has a lot going on, and is by far the best part of this rum.  The alcohol is well-integrated and it‚Äôs easy to nose.  It initially comes off as vaguely Jamaican to me.  Several different fruits, all slightly tempered by the oak: unripe bananas, green apple peels, and bosc pear skins.  Then nail polish remover and recently-waxed mahogany.  Savory notes of mild licorice root and kalamata olive juice.  Sweet notes of brown sugar cubes and caramelized bananas.  Finishes off with crumbled graham crackers, well-toasted coconut macaroons, and a dusting of fine cocoa powder.

On the Palate
In the mouth this is enjoyable, but not nearly as complex as the nose led me to expect.  Wonder if maybe the oak is covering things up.  I did, however, love the unctuous, oily mouthfeel.  Has a peaty entry, initially very Scotch-like.  That gives way to some brief banana notes, which are then buried beneath a savory avalanche of fennel pork salami and a hint of just-opened anchovy tin.  Fine oak tannins dry things out as the finish kicks in.

On the Finish
A warm and pleasant finish that blossoms quickly and disappears even more quickly.  Found the length of the finish and the lack of complexity a bit disappointing.  The waxed-mahogany notes from the nose and the oily mouthfeel turn into freshly-broken wax seal on the finish.  A whiff of peat returns, and the fennel pork salami morphs into caraway seeds.  Then *poof*, it‚Äôs gone.

Tasting Methodology
Tasted from a sample generously provided by u/SpicVanDyke - thank you!!  Open-tasted (not blind) on two different dates, first from a Glencairn Canadian glass, then from a Zalto Burgundy glass.  No water added.

Rating System Explanation
Ratings are on a 5-point scale, with plus, neutral, and minus modifiers for a total range of 15 possible ratings, with 5+ being the best and 1- the worst.  Numerical ratings are assigned on an absolute basis as follows:
1 - Strong dislike
2 - Dislike
3 - Neutral reaction
4 - Like
5 - Strong like
Pluses and minuses are then added, as necessary, based on a relative comparison to past experiences within the same numerical rating.",0,2020-10-15 01:45:19

curi0uslystr0ng,imksoz,1,rum,Top Shelf Bottles,"Hi guys,

  I am a Scotch drinker who also loves rum, but I have not ventured much into the realm of rums suitable for sipping.  I love mixing and making tiki drinks with rum, but rarely sip on it.  I am looking for a spirit on the high end that will change this.   As far as rum goes, when I mix with it I tend to reach for something with some funk to it, or create a split spirit base with something funky and something aged.   To give you an idea of the rums I like, right now I am mixing with Rim Fire, Pussers, Dr. Bird, Paranubes, and Real McCoy 10 Virgin Oak.  

&amp;#x200B;

Looking over my local selection, I see a few bottles that stand out:

&amp;#x200B;

\-FourSquare Nobilary

\-Foursquare Sagacity ( like wine cask finsihed Scotch so this one sounds interesting but it seems most folks prefer the Nobilary)

\-Rhum Clement 10 

\-Worthy Park Single Estate Reserve

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am leaning towards the Clement because I do not have anything from Martinique and I suspect it might strike a nice balance between the wood aged flavors and a light Agricole funk.   However, the high end Foursquare bottles have a great reputation.  I enjoy  Real McCoy 10, which I assume is similar, but usually add a little muddled lime and sugar to it.  I am looking for something I will enjoy neat.   The Worthy Park bottling is interesting to me because I love my Jamaican funk, but if its too funky I will probably want to add some lime to it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Your recommendations are greatly appreciated.  Thank you all.",16,2020-09-05 01:54:05

Paradigm-14,inu08z,1,rum,What else do I like?,"I posted here a while back looking for starter recommendations for something sweet and citrussy. The two bottles I bought following those were Rhum JM VSOP, and Pyrat XO.

I tried both one the Rhum JM tastes like ethanol and grass to me, might be because it's an Agricole, but I didn't particularly enjoy it, I had one drink from it and am now prepared to give the bottle away. Grassy is the only word I can use to describe it.

Whereas the Pyrat I love. Can't wait for the next pour, love it. I do realise now how divided this community is over Pyrat, even in the initial post there were divided opinions, on all websites where I ordered it there were conflicting reviews. I have read all the posts on this sub too which seem to have very differing content, but I can't help but really like the marmalade notes from it.

What else would I like if I am a big fan of Pyrat and definitely not Rhum JM VSOP? I guess I'm looking for a dark rum with added sugar? Sounds classy, but that's what I can't help but enjoy.

Any help appreciated, very much open to discussion too.

""Toffee-covered banana fritters to start, with the toffee notes gradually getting both more singed and fruity: baked apples, overripe pineapples and squishy bananas. Char notes build to balance the sweetness, with an accompaniment of bittersweet dark chocolate. ""

anonmarmot,iqg0n0,1,rum,"Demerara rums, revisiting Hamilton 86","Just a minor update. I think I was a little harsh on this guy but as a sipper I'm still definitely not a fan. I enjoy or at least don't mind the nose for the most part. In the mouth it's a little hot and burnt sugary which I am not a big fan of. The aftertaste to my tongue though is just nasty. It's still below a 5/10 for me though. For me it's a cocktail mixer and I'm not rushing to restock it.

I also tried the Hamilton black and much the same I really don't like it. I expected to like it actually given the reviews here or the odd mention. I actually dislike that guy more and holy shit was the part I dislike potent.

I also have the El Dorado 15. This one I like a lot better Beautiful smell enjoyable taste but there is just something at the end I really dislike. Some butter burnt sugar molasses thing. This one is sweeter and lacks as much bitterness and what I dislike has the volume turned down and mixed in but it's just part rather than being the main focus.

I think I may just not like demerara rums. Fight me. I mean I got some shit for disliking a rum last time most of you seem to thoroughly enjoy. I think there was some significant fundamental confusion on what a review is and isn't involved in that one. Reviews ARE subjective. Reviews SHOULD be subjective. One bad review should absolutely not make you avoid trying something and be viewed as a definitive objective predictor of YOUR experience. Reviewers are not judges at a competition rating how well a spirit fits it's style and the objective quality of said spirit. Listen to me don't listen to me whatever. The main benefit of reviews here is for me guiding purchases. Find someone who reviews are in line with your thoughts and THEN they become decent predictors of if you should spend your money on something.

Anyways a bit of a rant but I wanted to re-taste it and some other demerara rums to see if it was a style thing, a bad bottle thing, or an ""I ate something weird before the review"" thing. I think it's a style thing.",6,2020-09-11 08:31:57

anonmarmot,iqu15n,1,rum,Minimalist Tiki by Matt Pietrek (/u/CocktailWonk) &amp; Carrie Smith,"After tearing through the pages of [Minimalist Tiki](https://minimalisttiki.com/) I wanted to write a short and amateur review of it for the subs I frequent. I'm not affiliated in any way with the author, I just liked the book. 

You probably already own Smuggler's Cove and if you're like me you didn't feel the immediate need to check out other works on the same subject but let me tell you why you should. This book does a much better deep dive into Rum itself

Let's start with the shallow before we dive into the deep and acknowledge [the beauty of this book](https://i.imgur.com/75QAJ8F.jpeg). They obviously have a great eye for visuals and photography (or at least photographers) and that extends [well past the cover](https://i.imgur.com/k3UM4Sy.jpeg). The photographs are stunning and printed in high resolution. It's a beautiful tabletop tome. They include not only pretty pictures of bottles and bars and cocktails, but also informative pictures of tanks of molasses/stills/sugar-cane/etc.

This book is also exceptional for people new to tiki cocktails. It's wonderfully minimal, as it's title states. They lay out 30 golden era cocktails you should know and do [an amazing job letting you know how frequently ingredients for those appear in the cocktails](https://i.imgur.com/XYb8yXE.jpeg), and also [which cocktails use what](https://i.imgur.com/W0QH9j7.jpeg) so you can sync up what you're buying with your favorite tiki drinks. What this does is let new/somewhat-new to tiki know what to buy to START in which they'll get the biggest bang for their buck. First rum purchase and looking to make tiki drinks? Don't make it an agricole. For me this was not nearly as obvious in the Smuggler's Cove book but Minimalist Tiki gets straight to the meat of what I want to know. It also has whole chapters on technique, equipment, garnishes, syrups, and on and on. The beauty of this book is answering the questions you had when you bought the book, which it does wonderfully. It goes into their own rum classification which I personally prefer to the SC one. It gives specific rum recommendations for you to pick up, but also makes it clear what else works.

The book goes into rum with a very deep dive. I'm up over 40 bottles of rum (yo ho ho?) and have tried around double that. I've also read Smuggler's Cove cover to cover. I learned a lot about rum reading this book. Some highlights for me were the process of turning sugar cane into fermentable/distillable sugars and [the bit about Agricole being a seasonal product](https://i.imgur.com/DkshPEE.jpeg). It also [goes into the distilling process in a deeper way than I've heard it explained](https://i.imgur.com/6DN8dfO.jpeg) which goes into the types of stills, what makes Jamaican rum funky, the heads and tails of distilling, and so much more. It also covers the following processes of barrel aging, and on and on even to the producers and merchant bottlers and independent bottlers. It also covers something I thought was really cool ([1](https://i.imgur.com/opEZimF.jpeg), [2](https://i.imgur.com/iAZLNhN.jpeg)) which is the locations of distillers and the ways you could find out who the PRODUCER is of the rums on the shelf. Some rum brands don't make rum. I found that a little mind blowing but it's explained well in the book and we're told how to figure out (as much as we can) who makes what.

Beyond all that, if you needed more. The book goes into new recipes and ""The New Tiki Vanguard"" of bartenders and bars, giving the fresh lay of the land of now and the future of tiki. A lot of really interesting recipes are included in a refreshingly straight forward format. The book ends with [new riffs on it's essential 30 recipes](https://i.imgur.com/4qOUPqC.jpeg) many of which sound great and I look forward to drinking my way through in the coming months.

My only complaint would be that they left out the actual recipe's of their essential 30 cocktails. In the book they reference leaving them out for the sake of brevity and flow, and them being from Beachbum Berry's Total Tiki app. That app though is iPhone/iPad only however which is a bit of a shame as someone with an Android phone. These recipes aren't hard to find online (or through the Mixel app w/tiki pack, which is what I already had) but since the focus for newbies are on these 30 cocktails I would have preferred they be self contained within the book.

In summary it's a book worth a purchase even if you have other tiki books. New to Tiki? Get this. Want a beautiful coffee table tiki book? Get this. Want to know more about the spirit that is rum? Get this. Want to know about rum brands and bottlers and how that all works? Get this. Want to know some essential recipes? Get this. Want to know some new recipes you hadn't heard of but are being made currently in tiki bars? You know what to do by now. I highly recommend this wonderful book.


----

I began noticing this book by noticing fellow redditor /u/CocktailWonk. As I asked questions surrounding rum within reddit I kept having other redditors link his site an wonderful articles like [this article on E&amp;A Scheer](https://cocktailwonk.com/2016/02/the-most-important-rum-company-youve-never-heard-of-ea-scheer-rum-merchants-to-the-world.html) which I found absolutely enthralling and more recently [asking about Habitation Velier](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/ifwac2/can_someone_eli5_those_habitation_velier_rums/) and getting his articles linked like [Independent Rum Bottlers: The Real Story](https://cocktailwonk.com/2018/07/independent-rum-bottlers-real-story.html). [I'll also give a quick shout to The Lone Caner's article on Velier here](http://thelonecaner.com/the-age-of-veliers-demeraras-part-1/) and [his followup article on Habitation Velier](http://thelonecaner.com/key-rums-of-the-world-habitation-velier/). 

[The book is sold through his website](https://minimalisttiki.com/). [I initially looked for it on Amazon where it isn't, for which he cites the high costs of selling on Amazon](https://minimalisttiki.com/pages/international-shipping-costs). I buy it. They obviously went with a quality publisher willing to print their beautiful color images in high resolution. They've also included so many bartender recipes I imagine they probably had to pay for.

Just as a note I paid for this book with my own money and get nothing for hopefully convincing YOU to buy it. I just admire his work and appreciate the product I've purchased and think that you would too.",12,2020-09-12 00:37:04

I only have ever used Bacardi or Havana. I personally dont like the Havana taste and i red that Bacardi aint the best quality. So i came to ask if you know some rum for around 10-20‚Ç¨ thats solid. I am from Germany if that helps. Is Bacardi a good choice or a no go? I would make Mojitos, Daiquiries etc.",37,2020-09-12 20:32:55

I am primarily a Bourbon/Scotch drinker. However I enjoy trying new things and expanding my palate. Rum has always interested me but I just don‚Äôt know where to start. 

Anyway, today I took the plunge and bought a bottle of Dictador 12. I have to say I am impressed. From what I read this is a different style of Rum than the usual due to the Biofuel regulations in Colombia so I‚Äôm not sure how representative this is. 

Do you guys have any recommendations or must tries that I can look out for to acclimatize and expand my palate?

Cost is not really a consideration as long as we aren‚Äôt talking hundreds of dollars a bottle. 

Thanks in advance for the feedback.",14,2020-09-13 08:23:46

roobdogg,itm9jp,1,rum,Help me with my rum review scale...,"So I'm going to be doing some, (you guessed it) rum reviews. I'm planning to mix in some other spirits as well, as I think it's important in understanding and appreciating the category I love the most. I'm not sure how far I'll take it, but I'll be using my Instagram as the main platform for now since it's already spirits focused and do some sharing on the usual spots. Before I even get to that, I want to talk about scoring and your thoughts on it. I will be using a 100 point scale, simply because it makes the most sense to me if done properly. Hence where you fine folks come in. 

0-10  Varying levels of blindness - Terrible   
10-20 Terrible - Very Bad  
20-30 Very Bad - Bad  
30-40 Bad - Not Good  
40-50 Not Good - Okay  
50-60 Okay - Not Bad  
60-70 Not Bad - Good  
70-80 Good - Quality   
80-90 Quality - Amazing  
90-95 Amazing - Objectively perfect  
95-100 Objectively perfect - Subjectively Perfect  


Maybe theres a better way to title each section of points and would love to hear your thoughts. Regarding the top of the scale, I don't believe that there is much that is above 95 points to me, and if it is, I believe some of it must be tied to emotion or experience; I would heavily question myself if I honestly thought something was worth more than 95 points and I would make sure the review came with a salt shaker.  


Regarding other scales; I've read some thoughts on it from various reviewers, and I do feel that a 10pt scale does not offer as much nuance as I'd like, especially when comparing spirits that are likely only discernible as different in a side-by-side (however, I might submit it alongside my points for fun).",0,2020-09-16 09:42:31

I'm looking for that nice round sweetness (honey? caramel?) that is distinct from other kinds of sweetness from other whiskies I've had. I'm guessing this is from the rum.

Since I like these characteristics, I think I should try rum out.

Utsutsumujuru,i4i3mw,1,rum,Can Anyone Recommend a good intro Agricole?,"So I have had Rhum JM VSOP and Barbancourt 8 year. I did not like Barbancourt 8 year whatsoever and found Rhum JM to be just ok. 

So I am looking for a good Agricole that I can sip on and enjoy. I most enjoy Bajans and (Cuban influenced) Panamanian rums.  I also really like Appleton 12 and Smith &amp; Cross. But I like all of those for very different reasons. I like the Banana and Orange notes of Bajans;  I like the Molasses and Fine Tobacco notes of Cuban-Panamanian rums; and I like the Sangria fruit funk notes of the Jamaican rums. Surely there is an Agricole out there that I will fall in love with. I say that because...

Many years ago as an older teenager I got into my grandpa‚Äôs stash and had a Barbancourt that sent me to heaven. It turned me on to rum for life. Literally, that was the rum that me me say ‚Äúyeah this is precisely what I want‚Äù I remember vanilla, caramel, fresh cut grass, and orange peel. But because that was 20+ years ago and I was a teenager doing something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be doing I cannot remember which Barbancourt it was. I had the Barbancourt 8 year a while back and did not like it at all. 

So given that information does anyone know a good Agricole that has caramel and vanilla but also light citrus and grass notes...without being overly raw and harsh?

I know that is pretty specific but surely someone here has a good suggestion...",18,2020-08-06 09:09:20

Specifically, El Dorado 15 is my favorite (and, having tried both, totally worth the price difference between it and El Dorado 12 though some reviews disagreed).  Bars in my state are closed, and there's a plague and all, so I can't just go out and taste test by the glass, and it's getting expensive to buy entire bottles just to be disappointed.  I tried asking more experienced friends, and they directed me to fruity stuff that tastes like cough syrup.  I'm sure it'd make a lovely pina colada, but I have no interest in that.  So please, help me.  What do I love about El Dorado 15?  It smells precisely like my grandfather's wood shop.  Cut oak, curing tobacco, a wood burning stove, and it is smooth enough for me, a person who used to choke on straight hard liquor and thought it all tasted the way nail polish remover smells, to drink easily over ice.

I've loved the Rhum JM VSOP I bought, but the VO was already a much vegetal and wilder ride. The only white rhums I have experience of are the [Neisson Agricole Blanc 52.5%](https://www.finedrams.com/neisson-agricole-blanc-525.html) (which I find revolting) and [Trois Rivieres rhum blanc agricole 40%](https://www.finedrams.com/trois-rivieres-rhum-blanc-agricole-rum.html) (which was ok, nutty and earthy)

I have the 50% Rhum JM white and Clement's 40% and 50% versions available. There's also a ""rhum clement blanc canne bleue"" at 50%. Are all these as heavy and vegetal/earhty as the Neisson mentioned above, or are they more like the Trois rivieres?

Right now the Neisson will be sitting in my cabinet until the end of the world, so I'm trying to evade a similar scenario with whatever I try next.

The majority of ""cask strength"" rum releases tend to fall around 115-130 ish proof, suggesting that most rum products are being put into the barrel at lower proof points, similar to the 125 proof that is the maximum for barrel entry for bourbon. 

How, then, do we end up with 151? Does Demerara Distillers Ltd. put all of their rum into barrels at an even higher proof point than that? Do they simply dilute the likes of El Dorado down to its eventual bottle proof? Or do they distill to a variety of different strengths and fill barrels at different proofs in order to create different products?

Do all the other classic Caribbean/Central American/South American rum distilleries simply use lower barrel entry proofs? Or do they also put rum into barrels at higher than 151 proof, and then simply dilute it?",33,2020-08-13 22:49:47

I currently have El Dorado 15yr, Diplomatico Reserva 12yr, and Equiano. In the past I've had Plantation XO.

My favorite to this point has been the Plantation but as I don't currently have a bottle it's hard to compare directly. As for current bottles, I'm a big fan of the El Dorado. Maybe a tiny bit too sweet but overall I like it.

The Diplomatico i bought before I dove into the deep end of bourbon and scotch, with my palate a bit more refined now. I liked it before but now it tastes way too sweet and syrupy. 

The Equiano i bought on a whim after reading an article online about it. It's interesting. To my better but still very unrefined palate, it tastes a bit like a whiskey and rum mix. Based on that statement I should like it but it seems to miss the mark in my mind, for my tastes. 

With all that said, what is out there that's similar to Plantation XO and El Dorado 15yr but maybe a tiny bit more complex and ever so slightly less sweet. 

Thanks for any and all help/ recommendations.",3,2020-08-14 11:19:31
contraterrene,i9fj8z,1,rum,1st Review: Pusser's Rum,"Dear Rummies,

This is my first ever review of a rum, so please forgive my first clumsy wobble towards appreciation. 

Upon reading our own almost banned cocktailwonks circumnavigation around admiralty rum I was inspired to buy a bottle after a friend coughed up some money he owed me with interest. Happy days.

Also, apologies for retreading a very worn path.

Colour: Copper-hued Brown. Most appealing. 

Initial Aroma: Intensely boozy fruit pud with spices but not chrismassy, extremely refined and polite esters that invite further investigation.

First Sip: Controlled fire, mild sweetness that yields to a simmering dry heat.

Second Sip: More fire and heat this time but dryness now backed with a good spoon of molasses at the middle of the tongue. Really pronounced dryness. No idea where that initial sweetness came from.

Third sip: The dry molasses has waxed to the forefront, some harshness now on the aftertaste which is now a little like german pear distillates.

My usual sipping rum was pyrat because of it's sweet orangy balance, this is so far away from that I scarcely know where to begin. It's rough and ready, you can almost taste the distillation apparatus it was birthed in, further sips smooth the harshness out somewhat but not enough to render it polite.

As a historical expression of the base of navy grogham I completely get where this is going. I feel richer for trying it. 

This is going to be another tumbler of neat then I will use it as a mixer. This is not a condemnation as the taste is not at all bad but I feel that it's strength is as such.

Second tumbler goes down remarkably smooth, the molasses and pear are having a little dance together. May have been mistaken about mixing qualities. 

Mixed With: Surplus Trader Joe's fruit frenzy popsicle. 50/50.

Oh lawdy, lawdy lawdy.

I just had to play Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville on youtube to accompany this. One of the most unexpectedly delicious mixes I ever made. The absolute dryness of this rum balances out the aggressive fruity sweetness very well. 

Sorry kids, daddy is going to steal the rest of these and we will have to go back mid-afternoon to buy some more.

Well done that colonial.",3,2020-08-14 12:37:28

tscottf,hq0luk,1,rum,A Trio of Clairin Video Reviews,"Just an FYI that I just finished putting up series of videos on all the clairins currently available in the US. I previously did a post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/hk218a/intro\_to\_clairins\_and\_clairin\_milot\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/hk218a/intro_to_clairins_and_clairin_milot_from/)) for the introduction to the series and my review on the newer Clairin Milot ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfPbNw7RJO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfPbNw7RJO0)), but for the ones on the Velier series I figured I'd collect them all in one post rather than spamming everyone with each individual review. Here they are:

* **Clairin Vaval 2017** (Distillery Arawaks in Cavaillon, Haiti; Madam Meuze cane juice, wild fermented, pot distilled, master distiller Fritz Vaval, 50.5% ABV), 88+/100: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5A7qRo2x20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5A7qRo2x20)
* **Clairin Sajous 2017** (Distillery Chelo in St. Michel de l'Attalaye, Haiti; cristalline cane juice, wild fermented, pot distilled, master distiller Michel Sajous, 56.2% ABV), 91/100: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLWovIXhS70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLWovIXhS70)
* **Clairin Le Rocher 2018** (Distillery Le Rocher in Pignon, Haiti; cane syrup from undisclosed cane varieties, wild fermented, pot distilled, master distiller Bethel Romelus, 46.9% ABV), 87/100: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX2y3ycTzNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX2y3ycTzNA)

The main takeaway is that these are very good and that I'm well-impressed. The quality is generally high (although I've got my favorites among them) and the range of character is also huge. None of these are gigantic mouth-filling funk bombs like the Jamaicans - they're much more measured in nature - but they're also totally different from, for example, any rhum agricoles I can think of. Even the Le Rocher, which is probably the most traditionally rummy of the bunch, is difficult to compare to anything else on the market, and the other clairins really only compare to each other. They also swim like champs, especially the Sajous and Vaval. One thing I'm looking forward to is comparing other vintages of these same clairins, because they *are* going to be different and, potentially, better or worse (and as a note to other reviewers, please keep the vintage you're sampling in your notes if you have it available because when there's this many variables in the production that's going to matter). In the downtime I also talk a little about the history of Haiti and rum, why the Casimir incident is a good reason to support small producers, and where this category may go in the future. (Which, y'know, when you're a housebound middle-aged guy talking to a laptop, why not babble a bit.)

Anyhow, this represents one more data point out there on these things - I hope these reviews are useful for whoever might be interested.",0,2020-07-13 03:42:19

However I've been told to get Havana Club Especial as its better for Cuba Libres and  have had a friend say its alright in Mojitos. 

Is this true? Because I can use my white rum for both drinks but can you use gold for both or is this frowned upon.

vaporeon46,hrw0hw,1,rum,It‚Äôs crazy how much your taste can change.,"I used to love plantation xaymaca, yearned for it. the smell would just make me happy. Well, I finished that bottle, drank a bunch of different rum for a couple months, then bought another bottle of xaymaca. oh man i can‚Äôt stand it. even in a daiquiri. it just has some off flavor to it. 

or an even weirder example is how i got a bottle of chairman‚Äôs reserve master blender bitters &amp; bottles edition. absolutely love it, one of my favorite rums. but then one night i had it after a glass of velier hampden 2011 single jamaica rum, and it was not very enjoyable. a few nights later i have it again without any hampden first...love it again. 

and then there‚Äôs been rums that have grown on me after initial disappointment, like the transcontinental fiji. love that juice now. same with their panama rum, found it quite boring at first but now i enjoy it.

Favorites:

Bumbu: Another one that I really like, it‚Äôs super sweet which I like. 



Captain Morgan: rum and coke is still my go-to drink and the best way to have it is with captain Morgan imo cause it‚Äôs cheap and easy to drink.


Least favorite:


Diplom√°tico reserva: I only had this one time and I was drinking it straight but it just wasn‚Äôt what I liked and can‚Äôt really give a specific reason why.


Bumbu XO: was not sweet enough

\- looking for limited editions of high quality rums (from known brands) that are not too expensive but may be hard to find in a few years  
\- looking for chaning bottle designs and getting an old bottle before they take it off the market

What do you think and what tips do you have?

WearableBliss,h8ai90,9,rum,Foursquare pricing,"I may have asked this before but the fact that I still am not satisfied maybe means it is worth bringing  up again.

I am looking at these prices here in the UK:

Doorly's: 36-62

Exceptional cask series: 48-60

Foursquare Velier: 150-180

Is this bizarre? The guys in the store told me 'Don't buy Doorly's, it is made for mixing', then why does it cost almost the same as ECS? It doesnt in the US right?

The real thing I want to know, is there any way that the Velier releases are worth it? I can buy Sagacity, Nobiliary AND the upcoming 2008 for the same price as one plenipotenziario. By scotch logic, there is almost not way it is 3x better given it has the same specs. In bourbon logic, I'd happily pay 3x for a George T Stagg than for a random 15 yo knob creek, because bourbon is all about post-hoc barrel selection. If Foursquare rum is like bourbon, it could be the case that Plenipotentiario is 3x better than 2008 or Nobiliary. Also, these Foursquare Velier bottles might be the thing people will look back to in 10 years thinking 150 was a steal.

Rum blogs pretty much give all ECS or Velier releases the max score, so little help there. Their reviews reveal nothing that would suggest the 3x price is worth it. I would pay 20% more for the bottle and label design and velier swag. 

While we are at it, the rum blogs are bizarre and in that they put ECS and Velier next to each other and never mention one is 3x as expensive. Then they continue to mix a cocktail with the Velier. What the hell? This is more than one blog that works like this, what are they up to, why are they so weird? I think this would never happen in a bourbon or scotch blog.

So for Ardbeg, their core range is so good, that the special releases which are 3x the price are simply not worth it, because their core range is already tailored at enthusiasts. I have very little fomo about ardbeg special releases. Is it the same with Foursquare?",42,2020-06-14 00:20:48

WearableBliss,hcaa7c,1,rum,"Foursquare Velier judgment day, de-sulphuring Hereditas, Appleton vs El Dorado","So recently I made a post in which I asked, what is the deal with Foursquare Velier, it is 3x of the price of ECS in the UK. What is up. I have a Patrimonio for a special occasion but I can't bust that one open yet.

So the suggestion was to buy samples, which I am totally against. I will not pay a 2-3x markup per ml, and definitely not in a bar. At master of malt I bought some that were cheap (4-5 a sample) because some are good value, and I want some of those nice sturdy 30ml bottles.

Anyway, surprising, rhum attitude in france has the best prices for samples I have seen anywhere. For the more expensive bottles (100-150 euros) I think their markup per ml can be 40% or less, depending on the bottle. So I ordered 11 samples and got one for free even (8 yo Diamond 43%).

First downside: cheap bottles. These cannot be re-used. Bummer.

I have taken a bit of a break from rum so to get back into it I will start with a sample that has always had a question mark on it, and it is **El Dorado 21**. I had it in a fancy restaurant and loved it, but didn't want to buy a bottle because they add sugar. Now sipping it in the afternoon right before a bunch of zoom meetings, I have to say, it is not as classy as I remember it being in that expensive vancouver sushi restaurant. It is too fake-sweet, I expect a longer finish. I appreciate the muted funk. To me funk is a bit like smoke in scotch, something you can get addicted to in young spirit, and the ultimate class if it fades and matures over 2 decades in the cask.

So let's turn it into a tasting by comparing it to the **Appleton 21** I also ordered (I promise the rest is all Velier): Surprisingly similar, the biggest difference is that all the sugar is removed. Much dryer on arrival and finish, a good hit of oak. I expected more funk.

These two beg to be compared, abv, age, price (price is identical in france (100) and 90 vs 140 in UK, wtf). They are very close for me, I think I will find more in the Appleton if I give them more time. The sugarless integrity choice anyhow. With a bit of time I think the Appleton clearly takes it. It makes me happy that there are consistent, available options.

Off to the main act.

I am PUMPED now to get into the Velier releases I was able to order:

Principia and Plenipotentiazrio were the only Foursquare Velier releases I was able to secure

Then: Royal Navy Tiger Shark and Royal Navy LMDW. I would usually never buy bottles with so little info for so much money. Mount Gay Last Ward Habitation Velier and a 22 month of Clairin are the Veliers in the 'other' category.

**Plenipotentiazio vs 2005, blind**

I was able to guess which one the Velier is because I know 2005 well, but also because it is smoother and more muted. It has the perfumy part of the oak that Pappy also has and reminds me a bit of BTAC in general. Maybe because I also never owned a full bottle of btac, I drink it in a different frame of mind. 2005 has a bigger hit of flavour but also is harsher. Fuck I think it is clearly, but narrowly better. Maybe 10% better for 3x the price. 2005 makes you take breaks and get used to it a bit, Pleni P. is like liquid icecream that you can just drink until it kills you. Will I buy a bottle? Probably not but I am pumped I have the whole bottle of patrimonio.

This confirms a little bit my impression that Foursquare is like buffalo trace, it can produce a very cheap bottle and it can produce a highly expensive product, that are produced in the identical way, the difference is the barrel selection (not what barrels to put the spirit in, but which ones you after the fact select to bottle). From the enormous stock, cherry-picking the barrels that turned out the best after 10+ years makes a huge difference. My suspicion is that the main dimension of selection is smoothness actually, yeah, I said it.

When people say the pappy of rum they mean the hype, but I think it is true in two additional ways too.

**Principia vs Hereditas, blind**

First of all my hereditas is a sulphur bomb, Imagine having a nice sherried foursquare on the edge of a vulcano. I have put 100ml in a small bottle and added copper wires for a week to oxidize the sulphur. I predicted the wire would turn black, but the wire stays clear and now there is a fair amount of residue in the flask.

So in order to give the Principia a worthy opponent, we first need to do

**Hereditas raw vs Hereditas post copper wire treatment, blind**

So the biggest issue is, that the copperwired Hereditas remains cloudy even after filtering it through a very very fine sieve. I can immediately tell which one got the treatment. Yes, less sulphur, great. But its weird, sour, tastes a bit like pennies, terrible mouth feel. Reminds me of when I butter-washed bourbon and I didn't like the result. So, a waste of 100ml of hereditas. But, the original is still too sulphury to really enjoy. Maybe the next step is to oxidize it heavily.

**Hereditas raw vs Principia, blind**

I can immediately tell which one is which. No sulphur, great. But if pleni P is pappy, Principia is a older Knob Creek store pick. There is the same perfumy note again, but the whole thing is hotter and there is a woody note that strikes me as off early. Sipping Principia and Pleni side my side makes me feel like doing bourbon tastings, to me, it is never about how the bourbons distinguish each other positively, but just about their flaws that differ, wood notes that are too much like resin or harsh and dry. Those tastings are not nearly as fun as single malt where I think they can differ more in positive and specific notes that set them apart.

So, Velier Foursquare, mixed so far. Unlike ECS these are not blind buys for me I think. For this price it needs to be either consistently subtly better, or really in a different league. I am now worried the Patrimonio will be too much like the Principia.

All of this was done in a bit of a rush, I am glad the samples are 5cl so I get a bit more time with these, without the blind comparisons. Overall, what this exercise did was cure me a bit of my fomo and rum fever, and this feeling that I am passing on these rare black bottles and will regret it in the future. Good stuff but not on a different plane of existence. I think what I really want to taste is foursquare, aged in scotland in a refill cask for 20 years.

hmfreake,hcec3c,1,rum,"Origin story of ""Old Sam"" rum from Guyana","I'm hoping this community can help me locate some information on the origin story being Old Sam rum, specifically who ""Sam"" was and where he came from. 

The reason I'm asking is because today, my province in Canada had a staff member point out the logo and question it looking like a black man, and they are now trying to determine whether or not this logo has racist origins similar to what's happening with Aunt Jemima right now. Here is the local article for context: 

 [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/06/19/newfoundland-and-labrador-liquor-corp-reviewing-old-sam-rum-over-racist-branding-concerns.html](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/06/19/newfoundland-and-labrador-liquor-corp-reviewing-old-sam-rum-over-racist-branding-concerns.html) 

It seems that information surrounding the origin of the logo is difficult to find. The official website for the rum tells the story of a man named ""Sam"" who traveled to London from Guyana with a ship full his rum to sell. There are no sources linked to this story or a full name for ""Sam"", but they do specifically say that this happened in 1797:

 [http://www.oldsamrum.com/about-old-sam-rum](http://www.oldsamrum.com/about-old-sam-rum) 

"" Sam was a man who demanded much of himself, his workers and his rums, but brimmed with generosity for guests and friends.

By marrying traditional aged rums with his discriminating taste for quality ingredients, Sam established a reputation that, in the space of his own lifetime, travelled the seven seas over.""

Those two lines seem to be the only information I can find anywhere about the person this brand is named for. 

Our province is at risk of having Old Sam removed from our shelves by our liquor corporation. Many of our locals really enjoy this rum and are worried that it will stop being sold if we aren't able to determine the origin of the logo. 

I am hoping that someone in this community is able to provide me with some more details on the origin of the Old Sam rum brand so we can find out once and for all who Sam was, or if he was just a made up character all these years.",14,2020-06-20 10:45:39

Jettisonednet,hcg7ga,1,rum,New Rum Drinker: Doorly's or Barbancourt?,"Hey all,   


I'm relatively new to rum, and I've been enjoying Barbancourt 4 year + muddled lime + simple syrup + mint as a cocktail at night. Also enjoy with lemon substituted for lime. Total Wine is 50 mins away; can get Barbancourt 20 mins away. Is Doorly's (insert year) a good mixer for this nightcap, or should I be looking elsewhere? I'm \*very\* rural, and the liquor store next door has only Captain Morgan and Kraken. Next closest liquor store is 20 mins drive, but it is elite level and will custom order almost anything in the USA. I purchase Barbancourt because I want to support Haiti; I find the rum delicious mixed but a bit foul neat. I can drink Diplomatico Reserva all day. I am an absolute sweet tooth. Budget for mixing rum is around $25 per bottle at most, would prefer to save as much as possible.   


Current rum stash is Pusser's blue label, Appleton 12, Far North Nordic Spiced Rum (Minnesota brand remarkable with ginger ale), the Barbancourt, and Diplomatico Reserva. My palate is amateur; I like bourbon whiskey and Appleton 12 is tasty but still makes me gag a touch from the funk. Not ready for scotch-ish flavors or funkier rums. I'm well-versed in beer but am an absolute acolyte to spirits.   


Bought ""Smuggler's Cove"" on the $1.99 sale thanks to the r/tiki folks and am slowly--emphasis on the using a thermos mug to make cocktails--slowly doing cocktails. Intend to get a beginners cocktail set soon. Mint is homegrown. Ice is cloudy from my freezer. I have literally a shot glass and my wits right now. But, making a cocktail makes me happy, not from the alcoholic effects, but from the creation standpoint. I would like to learn more and am reading most the posts here, along with CocktailWonk, and doing independent research, and just happy to be along for the ride.   


Thanks for the advice and looking forward to your comments.",4,2020-06-20 13:07:42

**97% ABV, 11yr; finished for 3yr in a sherry hogshead; NCA, NCF; ~$40USD on Fine Drams, bottled by the Ultimate Whisky Company**

There's not a ton of info I can find online about this pour beyond the specs on the sales page, and I don't have much to add here beyond it sounded interesting so I finagled a sample.

----

**Highlights** - Nice presence on entry, a good burst of flavors with a smoky, candied nose

**Lowlights** - If you get this looking for Jamaican hogo funk, you're going to be disappointed. Gets a little bitter toward the finish

**A Few Tasting Notes** - plums, brown sugar, faint pipe tobacco

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - Barbancourt 8yr, Rhum JM VSOP

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This** - Plantation OFTD, Doctor Bird, Smith &amp; Cross

**Overall/Thoughts** - They might have left this in the ex-sherry just a bit too long.  I think this is good, but not great.   There's balance issues and I'm not sure what exactly it's trying to be.  You get a hint of the Jamaican fruitiness, but it's like they haven't rotted the fruit enough, as gross as that sounds.  But it is interesting enough to take a swing on for the price - I'd recommend this to someone who likes Doctor Bird, but wants less hogo and a slightly darker sherry profile. **73/100**",2,2020-05-10 00:53:19

Diplomatico Reserva is about $60 here, but how much better does it really get?

Nellynoway,gih39d,1,rum,"Dos Maderas 5+5 - Different bottles, different flavors?","Hello good people of r/rum

I recently discovered the Dos Maderas line of rums and the 5+5 version really intrigued be based on the fact that I'm into sweet rums and have a soft spot for port wine. I almost went ahead and ordered myself a bottle before noticing that there seems to have been a change of bottle/label maybe some 5 years ago. I figured this out after [reading a rumrating review](https://pasteboard.co/J843M7r.png), where this person states that [the old version](https://www.vinusvinis.com/1349/rum-dos-maderas-px-55.jpg) tasted significantly better than [the new version](https://www.uhrskov-vine.dk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1800x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/d/o/dos-maderas-5-5-triple_2_2/dos-maderas-caribbean-triple-aged-rum-5+5-ar-p.x.-40-31.jpg), saying the new is not as sweet or smooth but instead more influenced by burnt wood. 

Now, a single person isn't exactly a grand sample pool, but I figured I'd take the long shot and ask here if anyone has any kind of input to this claim. As of right now I feel like if I get sent the newer bottle when purchasing online (the only place to obtain it in my country) that I'm missing out on the ""true"" flavor/quality. Am I overthinking this matter?

Thank you for reading.",1,2020-05-13 02:24:39

Muser2213,ginmqt,1,rum,This one sure is different!,"Fairly new to the rum world but WOW... this one is nothing like I've ever had before!  

As soon as you pop the cork the aroma of fruit permeates the area.   If this would've been done blind I would have never guessed it was a rum... perhaps some sort of liqueur.  Strawberries...  dragon fruit...  mango... apricot... box of raisins... mixed with a little medicinal funk.  Who needs Febreze, just walk around the house with this!  That's how potent this stuff is.

On the palate the strawberries and dragon fruit persists with ripe pineapple and over-ripe bananas quickly coming through as well.   Mid-palate there's a hint of mint or menthol but it quickly fades back  into the tropical fruits.  This has a lonnnnng finish to it.  It has a Juicy Fruit gum, fruit salad, cherry Halls lozenge thing going.  I'm not a fan of sweet rums but there's a bit of a sweetness to it that's not off-putting *at all*.  Does not drink close to still strength despite the alcohol content (61.1% ABV).  

This is on another level altogether.  Got an email this was available and jumped at the chance.  So impressed I went and got a back-up.  Paid $64 in D/FW.

**Pre-Preface:**
  
 This is my first formal rum review, so please let me know if I can do this better somehow (I probably can). I hope you enjoy!

**Preface:**
  
Saint Lucia seems to be the not-so-secret up-and-comer of the rum game these days. So, imagine my delight when I was able to get my hands on a bottle of this -- Chairman‚Äôs Reserve ‚ÄúMaster‚Äôs Selection‚Äù, blended and crafted especially for use at Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago. This rum (according to the label) was made in a limited edition of 296 bottles. Writing that pains me -- very nearly the entirety of my bottle was consumed in a single night between a special lady and myself. Mostly myself.

We drank Zombies that night, though when later sipped neat, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the juice on its own. In fact, it made me regret using this rum in such a juice-forward cocktail. 

**The Facts:**
  
This rum is a blend of pot and column still -- 50% John Dore 1, and 50% column. It‚Äôs then aged for 8 years in ex-bourbon casks and bottled without chill-filtration at an admirable 54% ABV (take note, 40%-ers). This is a no-bullshit rum, to be sure, but it doesn‚Äôt cut corners. She‚Äôs a classy broad, this one, but she‚Äôll show you around. 

**Nose:**
  
On the nose, I was surprised at how funky this rum got. It was dripping with the way-too-ripe, don‚Äôt-eat-that banana notes that we‚Äôve all come to love. Those never really disappeared, but they stepped aside to make room for heavy raisin and brown sugar to join in the party. Trailing off, the rum exits with a purposeful note of golden hay and some vague but very pleasant vanilla. You really have to get your nose in the glass to get any of the ethanol burn, which is impressive for a 54% piece like this one. 

**Tasting:**
  
She thicc. There‚Äôs a whole lot going on here, but the funk isn‚Äôt as outstanding as the nose might suggest. Instead, the palate gets hit with some heavy wood, and pretty much every baking spice under the sun. Front and center are allspice and cinnamon. Vanilla sings its song all throughout, and in the best way -- not artificial and not obnoxious. Any of the hay that the nose promised seems to disappear, but I didn‚Äôt miss it. There‚Äôs a malty sort of flavor, too -- think Whoppers at the movie theater (or wherever). 

**2:1:1 Daiquiri:**
  
This made a solid daiquiri (most rums do, in my opinion), but I‚Äôd suggest that it doesn‚Äôt shine in the drink. The wood comes through nicely. Meanwhile, the maltiness seems to bounce off the lime as amicably as it knows how. It‚Äôs not a standard light-and-crisp daiquiri, but it‚Äôs nice enough to justify throwing it in there. I think the rum leans more towards a Tiki context, where the spice and malt play well with fruit-forward drinks.

**Closing/Rating:**
  

All in all, this is a damn fine rum and I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, given the bar on the label. And also given the bar on the label, it‚Äôs no shocker that it does well in tiki drinks. Or at least, in the 6-8 Zombies I had, it did pretty well. Knowing I‚Äôll never get my hands on another bottle stings a bit, and there‚Äôs a piece of me that wishes I hadn‚Äôt killed nearly all of it in one night. But sometimes, it just be that way. It was a good rum, a great night, and a shit morning.
  
**86/100**

**Overall/Thoughts** - It's a schizophrenic pour that isn't without a few good spots, but I just can't get the raw canned (salted) spinach note out of my head (mouth).  Excluding that, the pour goes generally hit a nice sweet/savory balance.  I get that agricoles get weird with the vegetal notes, and that's their charm/defining characteristic, but this one isn't for me.   I'd recommend skipping this and splurging on the XO if you're really wanting a really good Cl√©ment pour. **63/100**",5,2020-05-18 06:52:14

DragonicStar,glsjn5,1,rum,New Rum drinker looking for advice,"Hello there friends, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I just turned 21, a friend offered me a few shots of rum and I liked it a good deal. I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations as to different rums to try in different price ranges and if there are any specific brands/products that are universally considered to be incredible.

As far as general preference of taste goes I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so anything that is a bit more on that side of things that is quality would probably be a great recommendation!

I think the rum I have tried a bit of already is the Plantation Barbados 5 year and I thought that was pretty decent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the help guys!",6,2020-05-18 10:10:56

It was Venezuelan, and it's bottle was dark with the Venezuelan flag colours (yellow, blue and red) in band around the label.

**51.6% ABV, 2yr 4mo rum distilled/barreled/aged by Privateer in Massachusetts, USA, no additives**

There is [Way Too Much Information](https://seelbachs.com/products/privateer-rum-cask-strength-yankee-flyer-seelbachs) regarding the barreling and maturation of this offering.  For those of you needing to know the absolute minutiae of production, you will however be sorely disappointed, as the master distillery suspiciously left out the position of Saturn in Orion during the distillation period, as well as the maiden name of the nighttime security guard's mother-in-law.  Jokes aside, good on them for transparency, even if it is trending towards the ridiculous.  This is a rum fermented from ""real boiled brown sugar"" and molasses, and was sold through Seelbach's (sold out).

-----

**Highlights** - decent/typical Bajan nose - grilled tropical fruits; has a fantastic ""toasty"" savory finish

**Lowlights** - incredibly thin on the palate

**A Few Tasting Notes** - wheat toast, leather, white pepper, brown sugar

**Pours I've Liked a Little More** - Rhum JM VSOP; XXX/Six

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less** - Ultimatum Jamaica-Demarara 10yr; Clement XO

**Overall/Thoughts** - Initially comes off the nose like a traditional Bajan pour - think Doorly's with some extra heft.  Then it (surprisingly) falls of a cliff on the palate, before climbing it's way back up the ledge to safety on the finish.   The finish is really the star of the show here - it's dry and, if you'll forgive the outdated gender roles, masculine.  I'm not sure it would have as much utility as others in cocktails, but I'm not a big mix guy, so YMMV.  It's a unique and interesting pour despite the flaws.  I (generally) like it.  I'd recommend it for people who gravitate toward dry pours.  **73/100**",2,2020-05-21 06:33:51
Kempeth,gnl4t7,1,rum,Taking applications for a spot in my house bar ;),"I recently finished a bottle of Pusser's Navy Blue Label which means there is now an unsightly gap in the bottle line up that I'm looking to close.

I would love to get one of those Reddit favorites (If I can get them here). What would also be nice is to get something with a different cask finish. That's something I greatly enjoyed when visiting my friend and his Single Malt collection.

I do currently have a bottle of Zafra 21y Master Reserve which is aged in Burbon casks (which are pretty common as finishers) so I'd be looking for something else. I've pretty much enjoyed most of the rums I've tried so far:

* Zafra 21y Master Reserve
* Pusser's Navy Blue Label
* Plantation XO 20th
* Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva
* Diplomatico Mantuano (sinlge glass)
* Ron Millonario Solera 15
* HSE 2002-05
* Don Papa (single glass)
* El Dorado 15
* El Dorado 12 (single glass but prefered it to the 15)

I recall frequently reading praise of:

* Doorly's (I can find 3, 5, 12 and XO)
* Foursquare cask finish series (sold out I believe)
* Appleton Estate (I can find 12 and 21)
* Jamaican funk rums (??)

What would you recommend for me?",12,2020-05-21 07:02:13

I have been spending a lot of time reading books, researching the web, listening to podcasts to learn more and more about the most epic spirit of spirits and I am creating a rum-tasting that we could offer at the bar. 
Besides trying to inform the guests about its rich history and the interesting ways of making rum I off course want to have the guests experience the wide range of flavours that r(h)um has to offer.

Now I was wondering if you could give me some tips on:

-agricole rhums, we don't have them at the bar yet, I have tried a few a couple months ago and immediately fell in love. They were however from the same distillery and a bit pricy, what are your experiences with cheaper (below ‚Ç¨35) agricoles compared to the pricier ones and from which brand?

-I just started reading about demerara rums and was under the assumption that they were distilled from demerara sugar, but I stumbled upon an article that claims that it is just a term for rums originating from Guyana from the distillery located at the Demerara river. I know that there are rums to which demerara sugar has been added later on but what rums are actually distilled from demerara? And how do you feel about demerara rums as a category? 

-Any topics that you feel I definitely must dig into?

-what are your favorite rums? :)

Also, keep in mind that this tasting is not going to be ridiculously expensive, a lot of people are earning less money, I'd to offer a nice, whole experience for an honest price.

ABV ‚Äì ??%

Age Statement - NAS 

Purchased ‚Äì $NA/50ml 

Other info - ??

Tasted - Neat in a capped Glencairn after resting about 10 minutes, 1 drop water.

Nose -  A funky fruity nose, with a bit of molasses richness. 

Taste ‚Äì Palate is a bit overly spicy, presents with a nice, caramel fruity funk. This is more in the pineapple/guava funk, rather than the passionfruity, though it still has some seemingly barrel driven spice as we get to middle and close, bringing some toasty cardamom and other baking spices. Well balanced

Finish ‚Äì Not noted

Final Thoughts ‚Äì I could imagine this had some brandy influence, as there's a certain style of fruity mustiness here, but I can't say that for sure, and my brandy tasting notes vocab is not very large. Ends up drying out more on the finish, retaining some of that tannic-y barrel spice, and some of that lightly funky fruit. Sooo, perhaps a 7-9y plantation Jamaican rum at a middling proof?(like 45-50%)

Looking for some recommendations for a new rum to try. 

I've just finished my bottle of El Dorado 15 year old special reserve (which I really liked). I've got a bottle of Ron Zacapa centenario 23 (which I liked, but not as much).

I was also a fan of the Appleton Estate 12 year rare blend  so I guess I have a bit of a sweet tooth.

Any suggestions? Looking to spend ¬£50-70

cabbyintherye,g55633,1,rum,Effin New Guy,"So I literally just gave rum another shot (I hate that I chuckled at this unintentional pun) for the first time since college. I had too many shitty rum and cokes at a college party (Captain Morgan or Malibu no doubt) and had one of the worst hangovers in my life. Years later even just smelling rum would make me gag. I assumed that was it for me and rum.

Fast forward ten years and I thought I‚Äôd give it another try. Went and picked up a bottle of Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva based solely on reviews, and holy shit. I‚Äôve been missing out. I guess I always thought of rum as a fruity drink mixer (not that that‚Äôs a bad thing) and never realized it could be such a fantastic sipper. I‚Äôve been a bourbon guy for a long time, and now I haven‚Äôt touched my bourbon bottles since I picked up the bottle of Diplomatico.

My question is, where do I go now? I‚Äôd like to try a couple more sipping rums, and heard good things about Plantation, Don Papa, and Zacapa. Anything else or specifics about those? What about ‚Äúdark/black‚Äù rums like Gosling‚Äôs or spiced rums, are they worth trying? Open to all suggestions.",10,2020-04-21 08:45:50

METL_Master,g704k3,1,rum,Review #1: Velier Caroni 2000 17-year-old (US release),"From a stock of 7 barrels distilled entirely in 2000 and bottled at 110 proof, this is the first ""official"" Caroni to be imported into the United States. Aged entirely on Trinidad meant the barrels shared an 80% combined Angel‚Äôs Share. The ultra-powerful and intense offering captures the character of Caroni and its historical significance perfectly, reminding us why it was so prized by the British Navy, and now by us rum enthusiasts. 

ABV: 55%

Nose: Petroleum/gasoline, nail polish remover, dark fruits and molasses reminiscent of an aged El Dorado, surprisingly not a lot of hair singeing. After resting 25 minutes, not much on the nose changed for me except for maybe a little more honey and ginger coming through. 

Palate: Holy Jesus I was not expecting such a blast to my taste buds. Comes in with a punch from the abv straight to the tarry/gasoline notes. The second and third sip I get a bouquet of herbs that tastes like they were sitting in an oil slick and a very spicy ginger note. 

Finish: Looooooong. I‚Äôm going to be burping this one up for a while. I do get hints of caramel and certainly licorice on the end, but the gasoline is still very present. 

Rating: 5/10

This sample was sent to me by @Tan from the Aficionados Discord, so thank you to him for letting me be able to taste a Caroni for the first time! Overall, this was very interesting. I went into this fully knowing what I was getting into, but it still shocked me. I‚Äôm not clamoring to buy a bottle, but I can see the appeal to buyers looking for a unique spirit, especially for those that love very off-putting tastes, similar to those of peaty/briny Islay Scotches (here‚Äôs looking at you Ardbeg 10 CS).

defcaasi,fg7rdm,1,rum,Rum Review #1: Appleton Estate 12 Year,"**Appleton Estate 12 Year | Appleton Estate | 86 proof**

Tasted neat in a Glencairn glass and in an old fashioned. 

**Nose** \- Oak, caramel, and some orange. Not too much ethanol smell upfront, and this dissipates quite a bit as time goes on. Given enough time I also get some marshmallow notes. 

**Taste** \- It's undeniably Jamaican but in a toned down form with just a minor amount of funk. Oak is a prominent flavor and it‚Äôs backed up by some baking spice. There is no sugar added to this, but I do think its flavors lend it a subtle sweetness. Years ago I thought I was getting a lot of orange flavor, but at some point I tried Pyrat rum and now not even orange tastes that orange. 

**Cocktail** \- A lot of people recommend this as one of the main rums in a Mai Tai. It‚Äôs not bad there. Given my preferred blend of Mai Tai rums, Appleton 12 can get lost though. Where I think this rum really shines is a rum old fashioned. 2 oz Appleton, 1 barspoon 1:1 demerera syrup, 3 dashes of Bittercube Trinity bitters, and an orange peel. 

**Thoughts** \- This was my first real bottle of rum I purchased after deciding that I wanted to get more into rum and it will always be one of my favorites. Appleton 12 is a great rum. At its low price you can use this as a daily sipper or in cocktails. I‚Äôll often find myself having a pour when I want something easy to drink. It‚Äôs also a great stepping stone when exploring what rum has to offer or for converting your whiskey drinking friends.  

**Score - 4**

\------------------------------------

**Review scale** 

1 - Undrinkable

2 - It‚Äôs ok, kind of like ordering a gin and tonic at a wedding.

3 - Good! A bit above average! Wouldn't mind having this around. 

4 - Great, always happy to have a pour 

5 - Exceptional",0,2020-03-10 11:46:01

csh8428,fm55qe,1,rum,"Looking for similar rum to BumBu, but with a little more bite","I used to be a bourbon guy. I always preferred the sweeter bourbons as opposed to the more oakey ones. I recently got on a rum kick and looked for something similar for a sipping rum. After reading lots of reviews I settled on BumBu Original. I REALLY liked it! It was sweet... almost overly so, but not quite. The only thing I wanted a little more of was alcohol bite. It doesn't have to be less sweet, just looking for more bite/spice. I really don't feel like reading for hours again to find something similar. I guess you could say 

**tl;dr: Looking for recommendations with similar taste profile as Bumbu Original, but with more bite.** I like molasses/caramel/toffee sweetness. The more oakey/peppery/tobacco flavor, the less I like it. It has to be widely available in the US at stores like Total Wine and under $40. I live in GA, so getting it in the mail is a no-go


Thanks for any help!!",2,2020-03-21 07:32:21

I'm looking to try something new but somewhat similar to start to open my pallet for more rums.  I have had Mount Gay black barrel and didnt really like it. It was very similar to whiskey and I have had a few bad experiences with whiskey so it ruined the taste for me. Maybe I was just too new to rum at the time to enjoy it or maybe I just got the wrong one? I would love to open my pallet though so I am open to recommendations.",9,2020-03-21 11:14:19

wilumberman,foihsu,1,rum,Review #4 XXX/four yummy rum,"**Backstory:** I‚Äôve been wanting to write this review for a good long time. Then, all of a sudden ‚ÄúSalut to Your Solution‚Äù by the Raconteurs came on the music box and it was time. Time to buckle in and write this review. This review of this absolute gem. I cannot believe how lucky we are to be treated to some thing so extravagant, but such is the age we live in.  For now, it is time‚Ä¶time to talk about it.

&amp;#x200B;

 **BRAND:** XXX/four 

&amp;#x200B;

**DISTILLER:** Somewhere in the South Pacific. Aged in the Philippines. Finished in American Oak in England.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROVENANCE:** See above but by way of Fiji.

Distilled in 2004 until 2016 then finished in American Oak until 2020 in England. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Proof:** 133.8 (ABV 66.8) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Tasted:** Neat in a glencairn 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Beginning (Nose):** Apple, Cinnamon but really much more like Red Hots (the candy) 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Middle (Taste):** A total time bomb. It starts out with that apple then move to the cinnamon heat but then out of nowhere you are hit with a salty leather bomb like a straight left jab from a boxer‚Äôs sweaty glove. Going to dried out pepper cherry (whatever that is- when you‚Äôve tried it you know) 

&amp;#x200B;

**The End (Finish):** Ridiculously lingering and Tingley (yes that is a capitalized adjective).In Sum: Straight up out of the park. A re-donkulous and sublime treatment of rum fantazim. It‚Äôs sweet yet dry, it is pepper yet salty it lingers yet leaves you wanton. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rank: 8** 

Decoded: 

1 | Awful | Probably could take the paint off your car

 2 | Terrible | immediately stop drinking and only give to someone you don‚Äôt like 

3 | Bad | Has Flaws and would pass if offered for free 

4 | Sub-par | Not bad, Drinkable but many things I'd rather have. 

5 | Good | Good, Totally acceptable. 

6 | Very Good | A cut above. definitely a spirit I would support. 

7 | Great | Something you can get excited about- well above average 

8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional- damn fine. 

9 | Incredible | An all-time favorite 

10 | Perfect | Perfect",2,2020-03-25 10:28:47

ScotchBrandyBourbon,f2ap77,1,rum,Rum beginner. Need help.,"Here are the bottles I have and tried:

Appleton 12. Not bad. A bit to simple for me. Enjoyable but taste mostly like molasses.

Hamilton 86 and 151 Demerara. I think these are for mixing. Tried them neat (yikes for 151) and were a bit harsh. I'm looking for sipping rums. I have a mixed drink maybe once every 5 years.

Hamilton St Lucia 7 Cask Strength. My favorite. It is very funky and has almost a metallic note that I don't love. But it is rich in flavor.

I come from mostly a Scotch background. Is there any Rum's you recommend? I'm not really into the massive funk element. Looking for something that is balanced (not too sweet) but still flavorful. Complexity would be great also. My budget is about $60.

XXX/One - this one is easy... Foursquare, cuz that's what this was.

XXX/Two - ???.  I've heard the profile is quite similar to Foursquare/Barbados rum so maybe that will work for this one, too?

XXX/Four - Similar to two but more fruity, so perhaps Foursquare would work for this one, too.

XXX/Six - I'm sure there are other agricoles out there that could be comparable to this one.

No ideas on XXX/Three or Five, honestly.  I don't know rum that well so I have no idea what would be a comparable, non-limited bottling.

Pretty boring after coming over from the whiskey world. I was thinking, is this it? But I was kinda warned it could be a less than exciting pick. Then today I did a SBSBSBSBS with 5 new rums I've never had. I took my cue from Tarquin's list that sounded interesting. I lined them up in order of proof and went at it. Wanted to try a nice mix with different regions, although Jamaica is showing up in 3 of these. The lineup was:

1. Clement XO
2.  Barbancourt 15
3.  Hamilton 114 Navy Strength
4.  Stolen Overproof
5.  OFTD

I loved them all even though they are so different.. The Clement XO reminded me of a nice, easy, elegant sipping whiskey. The Barbancourt was deep, classy and soft. Subtle. Was thinking it could be a nice dessert sip. Hamilton blew me away. Banana, cardamom, fruit coctail and oaky tobacco. Mesmerizing! Stolen was a funky pineapple punch in the mouth with a bit of nice rubber thrown in for good measure. OFTD was heaven. My goodness...Citrus, stone fruits and vanilla chocolate with dried fruits. Some whiskey caramel and oak, but sweeter. It was the only one I tried a couple drops of water in and I could do it either way. Anyway, I think I'm in a good bit of trouble now.

**Preface** - Love the song, gonna see if either of these can live up to the pun.  Been sipping on a bottle of the 3 star, and just got a mini for the Rhum J.M. in an online order.

------

**Review #14 - Rhum Barbancourt 4 year ""3 Star"" - 43% ABV, 4 year Haitian agricole, color added (booo). approx $25/750mL**

**Highlights** - decent oak and spice notes despite its youth; with some hunting, a pleasant nose

**Lowlights** - faint on the nose, light on the palate, thin mouthfeel, drinks a little hot for a rum this proof (but it's a non-issue for me coming from bourbon)

**A Few Tasting Notes** - oak, vanilla, some floral/grassy components

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - Diplomatico Reserve Exclusiva, Doorly's 12 year

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This ** - Doorly's 8 year, Doorly's XO

**Overall** - **61/100** It's not bad!  But it's also not good!  This doesn't make me want to rhum to the hills or for my life.   Given the profile similarities, I think this would be a good gateway r(h)um coming over as a cheap bourbon drinker.  I like the 8 year/5 star quite a bit better than this, and while I'm on that train, let me tell you that I frankly think it's bullshit that they don't have a consistent ratio between years aged and stars. Either make it 8 year/6 stars, or 4 years/2.5 stars, it's not that hard and it's just confusing to the consum - oh sorry, this isn't a Wendy's drivethru.

--------

**Review #15 - Rhum J.M. VSOP - 43% ABV, 3+ year Martinique agricole aged in ex-bourbon, ~$50/750mL

**Highlights** - a dank, dark nose (just a smidge on the funky side); tastes like literal cigar on the palate

**Lowlights** - borders on being overpowered by the smoky note, a little pricey

**A Few Tasting Notes** - clove, cigar wrapper, honey

**Pours I've ~~Slightly~~ Preferred to This** - XXX/Two, XXX/Three (haven't had anything that's ""slightly"" better) 

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This ** - Barbancourt 8 year/5 star

**Overall** - **74/100** - I like this, a lot - I would (Whitney Houston) Rhum To You, J.M.  It's right in my wheelhouse: smoky, a little spicy with some earthiness, just a bit of sweetness for balance.  If you like cigars, I can't imagine you not liking this pour.   It drinks well, has complexity, uniqueness, personality, and isn't overly sweet - all traits that I share with it.

------

**Verdict** - despite the specs (similar age, proof, distillate), this really wasn't a fair fight.  Rhum J.M. VSOP is a premium product costing twice the MSRP of Barbancourt 4 year/3 stars.  Pitting it against the 8 year/5 stars would've made it a more competitive fight, but the result would've been undeniably the same.  My wallet weeps in fear if the JM VSOP is indicative of what a properly-done agricole tastes like.  Thanks for the read - cheers!",2,2020-01-15 14:00:54

Last week I announced the XXX/Four, XXX/Five and XXX/Six rums. Today I am here to bring you the complete tasting panel notes for the three rums we selected, so that you may all see what you are in for. 

As a reminder, chapters 4, 5 and 6 are:

- **XXX/Four** will be a single cask rum from Fiji, distilled in 2004 and bottled at 66.8% ABV. It was distilled using a pot still at South Pacific from molasses, aged in the Philippines until 2016, finished in American oak cask #3 in England and bottled on 8th of January 2020. The yield is 214 bottles, and there is no filtering, coloring or additives of any kind. No bullshit as always. 

- **XXX/Five** will be a bottling of rum from Jamaica that is two years old and bottled at 65% ABV. It was distilled from molasses in Saint Catherine, Jamaica using a pot still, aged for 2 years in Jamaica and bottled on 1.9.2020. Chemical analysis reveals ester counts at 67.7 g/hLAA, and total volatile substance counts of 529.8 g/hLAA. The yield is 400 bottles, and there is no filtering, coloring or additives of any kind. No bullshit as always.

- **XXX/Six** will be a bottling of rum from Mauritius, distilled in 2010 and bottled at 67.2% ABV. It was distilled from cane juice, using a column still in Mauritius,aged in oak casks in Mauritius until the start of 2018 and finished in first-fill Bourbon cask #2 in England. The yield is 260 bottles, and there is no filtering, coloring or additives of any kind. No bullshit as always.

and here are their tasting notes:

##XXX/Four:

|Username|Nose|Taste|Finish|Overall|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|tjw|Salted caramel, nail polish, sweet oak, yeasty bread dough|Dusty books, mildew, sushi roll, saw dust|Mildew, tropical fruits, dirt, new oak|Not bad, not great. About middle of the road. While the tasting notes seem bad, its‚Äö not bad. Heavy old book taste.|
|TheAgaveFairy|Compared to some others in the run that were a similar style, at first there‚Äö' almost a light grassy initial smell but then you get that rich vanilla core, the really classic profile grows. Spices, nuts, citrus, touches of mocha, coconut, caramel.|Warm entry, super classic event, texture is just where it needs to be.|Tinge of peppermint, decent length, balanced.|Not the most exciting, but damn solid. A very good ‚Äö its just a want a rum pour. I wonder if it is DDL or somebody cool like that.|
|G-List|Varnish, pine, a little creosote on top of rich brown sugar|Warm, thick, sweet. Spices, sweet and planty like chewing on sugar cane|Oak, cherry syrup|Lots of body and just a hint of grassy funk. Cane juice style?|
|Whiskey Curator|Caramel, clove cigars, fake banana, chocolate, stone fruit, leather conditioner, sweet oak, chocolate, grapes|Overwhelming brown sugar, marshmallow, pecan pie, oven roasted wood chips, black pepper, earthy funk|Dry, sweet, oak, cigar, sherry|Very sweet nose, with an assortment of toasted sweets, baked goods with a solid followthrough on the nose. Guessing Barbados or Trinidad|
|Pwnedapanda|Vanilla and caramel. Almost no funk. Very sweet nose. Bananas.|Classic, nutmeg, caramel, apples, pear, guava. Some rubber, more sweet.|Pretty bland, hints of vanilla. Some apple again. Banana bread.|While the finish fell a little flat, this was by far my favorite of the whole group. I like things to be more on the sweet side vs. funky, and I found that here, along with very rich flavor.|
|Rusty|Rich, Full, Candy Syrup|Little hot, sweet, bright, good fruit funk|medium long, warm|very good but not special|
|t8ke|Honey, molasses, ethanol and lime. Nice orange note. Some tobacco, wood shavings. Light mango but not impressively fruity.|Really delicious. Medium mouth feel. Some heat. Molasses, oak, bourbon, vanilla. Cinnamon. Toffee, mango and light papaya. Some oak.|Growing heat. Hot hot hot. Super bourbon-y. Reminds me of XXX:One and Barbados distillate. Oak, maple, vanilla, honey, some cherry. Would believe it was Stagg Jr on the right day.|I like this, and it's darn good rum, but it's not something I think I'd reach for that often.|
|Cojirob|Fresh sugarcane juice, orange juice, papaya, pineapple juice, sugar cookie, rain soaked slate, bare hint of rubber, public pool chlorine air, caramel Stroopwafle.|Very sweet, melted rock candy, caramel corn, slightly stale pressed sugarcane juice, barrel char influence, generic wood.|Big dose of peppery heat, a little bit of astringency, ginger, black pepper, cola, corn oil, barrel char, bitter wood, generic herbs, leather wallet, stale vanilla.|Solid, although this seems very similar/identical to #1, slightly lacking in depth, it seems like a younger rum aged in ex-bourbon barrels. The finish is a bit hot as well.|
|stormstatic|Has that aged agricole nose ‚Äö'√¨ vanilla, orange peel, caramel, a touch of grass and hay, some acetone and red fruit.|Whoa, big boy. Floral and not super rich ‚Äö'√¨ honey, fresh flowers, elderberries, spicy rye.|Big and long. This is a punchy one.|This is objectively high quality but not really my style.|
|Anxst|Molasses, vanilla, calendula, warm copper/metallic.|Sweet vanilla, maple syrup, golden syrup, red berries, allspice, peaches, mango, cashew, strawberry jam.|Warm baking spices, cinnamon, dry grass, clove, honey.|Complex. A lot going on. Very hot, water tamed it well.|
|Texacer|light strawberry and marshmallow cereal|fruit, marshmallows, mango, sweet and juicy. honey, caramel and cocoa|long|wonderful|
|Tarquin_Underspoon|Vanilla bean, toasted marshmallow, maple sugar, snickerdoodle cookies, toasted coconut, oak, funnel cake, allspice.|Vanilla bean, maple sugar, candied orange peel, Mexican coconut candy, toffee, cocoa nibs, allspice, salted caramel, sweet basil, oak.|Somewhat longer than average. Vanilla bean, Demerara sugar, cocoa nibs, maple sugar, toasted coconut, allspice, marshmallows, candied orange peel, dried apricots, sweet basil.|Sample four is a tad frustrating to me. On one hand, it features a rich, fat, satisfying palate and finish, reminiscent of some of the better Barbadian rums that I‚Äö've sampled. On the other, the nose is a tad closed off, even after the addition of a little water, and the entire experience is a couple notches too cloyingly sweet and vanilla-y for my tastes. I suspect that this pick will appeal more to the hard-core Foursquare fans than to a funk-fiend like myself.|
|HomeBarGirl|Tasted in NEAT glass. Let sit for 5 mins, nosing throughout. Lightly grassy. Mid-level, golden molasses. Apple! Not green apple, but bright, juicy, lightly tart apple. Why am I also getting grape notes? Some stones and minerals.|Char, black pepper, spices, incredibly hot. wide fruity shit. a really nice caramel hit though the middle. salted caramel? Wow this is delicious. dried flakey cereal in the wide second sip. I mean, like, holy shit this is hot. But also such an enjoyable taste. so many different flavors, so many exciting sensations in my mouth.|hot, fruity, cereal in the width, minerals underneath, dry grasses running through. also dry digestive biscuits. lingering stone fruits.|fun. fuck yeah. really fun, lively and killer experience. Tasted again 20 mins later and FUCK YEAH. I want it in my life.|
|xreekinghavocx|prominent artificial something, canned jackfruit, diluted cranberry juice|syrupy! a kind of savory almost licorice note, grape and plum and strawberry reduction, ginger beer|more strawberry syrup|Yum. I'm not entirely sure what to make of this one; would be happy to drink more of it. 55% ABV, 8-10 years old?|

##XXX/Five:

|Username|Nose|Taste|Finish|Overall|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|tjw|Butter rum lifesavers, old warehouse, sourdough, marshmallow, runny caramel|Papaya, runny caramel, leather, superball|Papaya, tropical fruits|Pretty good for a light rum. Seems more like a dark rum. Flavors are nice and alcohol heat is high.|
|TheAgaveFairy|Esters! Mangoes, vanilla, nutmeg, lemon swath, aromatic, touch of herbal, starfruit, blossom.|A goofy tinge of marshmallow on the entry, esters driving the main event.|A touch tannic and evolving, cinnamon and strawberries.|I think a more neutral cask here. Full, but a little hot. Sold Jamaican.|
|Rusty|Pleasant, rounded, standard rum|Sugar, varnish, mild funk|solid funk that continues to give|its good, and gets better as it opens up|
|G-List|Esters, butterscotch, hint of spearmint|Metallic ester tang, astringent, pencil eraser|Light smoke and rubber|Lightly aged midester Jamaican? Not punchy enough to hit the mark of Hampden LROK or similar, not sweet enough to give a good balance either.|
|Whiskey Curator|Aged cheddar, sugar cane, funk, unripened mangos, bergamot, wet leaves, cotton candy|Floral, hibiscus, honey, green grapes, pandan, funk, marshmallow, pine|Long, pine, honey|Pleasant agricole style rum with a very nice sweet floral nose, backed up completely with a palate follow through.|
|Pwnedapanda|Back to dry funk. Papyrus, waxy. Hints of ash.|More candles. Waxy funk, fairly boring.|Did this just vanish? Little bits of citrus.|The dry, waxy character of this was interesting, but it had almost no finish whatsoever, and I that really killed it.|
|t8ke|Salted caramel, melon, honey, lemon and a great molasses note. Banana, pepper, tobacco and a light funk only adds to the bouquet.|Medium mouth feel. Oak, honey, light funk and pepper. Pipe tobacco, sweet sweet molasses, almost a sherry or madeira note. Nice and wine forward to blend with caramel and oak. Ethanol grows with time but nicely.|Short but delightful. Complex, loaded with molasses honey, light melon and pineapple funk. Bright, complex, effervescent. Big fan of this,.|This may be my ace in the hole. I love this one.|
|Cojirob|Prickly sugarcane funk, sour cactus fruit, pineapple, papaya skin, orange rind, orange juice, caramel cream chews, pink fondant frosting, sherbet fruit punch.|: Fresh cut pineapple, spicy pepper, milk chocolate, dry wood.|Strong, hot and punishing finish with a surge of astringency and peppery burning spice. Simmers down to dry wood, herbal throat lozenge, dried fish, Christmas strawberry hard candy.|It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a fine run, though a bit generic and plain. The finish is again unforgivingly punishing, detracting from the overall enjoyment of this one. In fact this is fairly similar to sample 5.|
|stormstatic|Back to funkland. Pineapple, banana, marshmallow. Love this smell, I just stuck my nose so far into the glass that it got wet. I want to bathe in this smell. Golden and beautiful, funky sunshine.|Doesn't disappoint, following the nose. Nice chewy mouthfeel, esters bouncing around everywhere. Pecan pie, crayons, banana bread, oatmeal cookies, dark chocolate covered coffee beans.|The only disappointing part of this rum. Pretty short, unmiraculous finish.|Probably my favorite so far. Has a Jamaican-style funk without feeling...too Jamaican if that makes any sense, which it doesn't. Lots of deep, rich dessert-like notes, surprisingly considering it looks on the younger side. Big fan.|
|Tarquin_Underspoon|Creamy vanilla, cardamom pods, sandalwood, allspice, cantaloupe, toasted almonds, molasses, sourdough bread, chlorine, wintergreen, creamed corn.|Creamy vanilla, sandalwood, molasses, wintergreen, medicinal funk, star anise, clove, sourdough bread, dried pineapple, dried apple slices, chili mango.|Creamy vanilla, molasses, wintergreen, star anise, dried pineapple, medicinal funk, apple dumplings, almond butter, sandalwood, pickled onions.|Sample 9 reads like a rather typical English pure-pot-still molasses rum. There‚Äöis nothing wrong with it, per se, but it‚Äöis a touch too thin all around, and it lacks any characteristics that might cause it to stand out from the indie-bottled Demeraras or St. Lucias that are already on the market. In other words, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s good but not great. And we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re looking for greatness here, so I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll bestow a middling score upon it and leave it at that.|
|HomeBarGirl|Tasted in NEAT glass. Let sit for 5 mins, nosing throughout. Smells like we back in Jamaica? Or some kind of dunder funk. Hella fruity. Hella pungent. Bread. Yeasty. Dry crackers, dry grasses, Bright fruit throughout. Light caramel, lightly burnt sugar coming through at the end. A bit of minerals.|oh shit. This is absolutely delightful. Its light, bright, briny, fun, a bit of honey, a lot of grassy notes, I love this.|fruity, a bit sweet, a lot of grass, light and delightful.|Love this. Want this.|
|Anxst|Clover, minerals, orange peel, mango, earth, magnolia, bergamot.|honey, sugared limes, wet stone/mineral, mango, hibiscus. Floral.|Citrus, fresh cut birch, honeyed flowers.|This was pretty fantastic. Light and airy, fairly floral, the earth/mineral flavors balanced it.|
|xreekinghavocx|pungent and funky. grape ester, banana ester, styrene, sauternes-cask tropical fruitiness|elmer's glue, jackfruit, lychee, salted caramel|crunchy, fades to bubblegum|delicious|
|Texacer|tart fruit, sandlewood, beachy, raspberry jam|marshmallow and mango jam. heat on the end, bit of bunk, molasses|medium|its okay|

-----

##XXX/Six:

|Username|Nose|Taste|Finish|Overall|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|tjw|Lemon bars, dried prunes, cotton candy, aged meats|Dried pineapple, fruitcake, dried apricot|Dried apricot|Good, and very different. Apricot is heavy, as is the dried pineapple. Really takes you to an island paradise.|
|TheAgaveFairy|More agricole! Sharper orange and cinammon, with a little roobois ‚ÄöaPike Place tea throwbacks. Earthy tropical fruits, a touch of sour pineapple, green peppercorns.|Reminds me a lot of Neisson, much more spices here than the nose ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ fascinating.|Great development, long, complex.|Fuck yea, again, reminds me of why I like Neissons. The discord (ha) between the nose and palate regarding spices is really interesting.|
|Rusty|What the fuck is this? wet. cardboard. particle board.|no. dusty, bad funk, not rummy|dusty. medium length.|This is terrible rum or very good agricole... but i aint in the mood for agricole|
|G-List|Menthol, eucalyptus, brown listerine, cheap movie theater popcorn|Ashy scotch, listerine, toothpaste, chalky root beer candy|Burnt corn, ashes|Ooh wow I did not like this. Bitter, ashy, medicinal, and not the good kind like you want. The Malort of rum.|
|Whiskey Curator|Curry, coconut, peanuts, pandan, medicinal, grape cough syrup, coriander, plastic|Hot, savory taffy, Brazil nuts, tobacco, lime peel|Leather, oily, astringent, long, savory|This reminds me of half the street food I had in Thailand on the nose, the palate is kind of a savory bomb of not so great combinations.|
|Pwnedapanda|Cereal grains. Honey comb, peppery, a little mint.|Honey, candles, fake cinnamon. Sour. Over ripe citrus.|Cardboard. Pencil shavings. Honey.|This was again interesting in breadth of flavor, not necessarily depth. There was a bit going on, but it fell off fast.|
|t8ke|Nutty sweetness. Almost amaretto like. Pipe tobacco. Sweet confectioners sugar. Melon. Light root beer.|Sweet and grassy, Also weirdly cinnamon forward. Super grassy. Really weird and herbal. Agricole, is dis u?|Short, but powerful. Minty, herbal, funky, it's all there.|Wild, insane, grassy, cane I have to imagine. This will be a love hate for sure|
|Cojirob|Sweet and sanguine with honeydew melon, agave syrup, green grapes, bare hint of spearmint and pine, medicinal licorice, beef fat, slight rubbing alcohol when nosing too deep, raw animal pelt funkiness, caramel hard candies.|Dry and light mouthfeel, muted sweetness, dry oak, chili pepper spiciness, caramel chews, corn silk.|Medium amount of astringency, warming, rancid animal fat, very drying, oak barrel, grape skin, BBQ chicken, vinyl, just a bit floral.|Ok, its not the most complex of rums in the list, but it is a very unique one. The opening nose causes a lot of expectation with its sweet and green fruit notes, while the taste is off in some other direction with its light, dry and slightly spicy qualities. The finish keeps with the taste but inserts a big dose of sugarcane funk in the rancid animal fat, cured pelt type taste, which thankfully quickly fades away leaving the remaining flavors. Really very interesting.|
|stormstatic|Pretty faint nose, not getting a lot at first. A little SE asian notes ‚Äö√Ñ√¨¬¨‚Ä†lemongrass, coconut, spice. Some plastic. Not getting much else.|Significantly more flavorful than the nose let on. Again this one tastes a bit like cane juice, or maybe a blend of cane and molasses. Candied ginger, nutmeg, spice cake.|Pretty nice finish, the christmassy spice cake lingers.|Above average but that's about it. Missing some depth of flavor, for me.|
|Tarquin_Underspoon|Brine, creamy vanilla, wet stone, Japanese pickles, fennel bulb, fresh watermelon, wallpaper paste, wilted spinach, passionfruit, green papaya.|Brine, Rose‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lime juice, sweet vinegar drink, apple cider, fennel bulb, glue, star anise, kumquat skin, coriander seed, creamy vanilla, Bartlett pears.|Average length. Brine, wild raspberries, apple cider, star anise, key lime, wet stone, peppermint, Juicy Fruit gum, Sichuan peppercorn, fresh cucumber.|Sample 8 is another strange one, but in more pleasing ways than 7. The nose is a bit shy at first, but it creeps up on you with increasing complexity. The palate manages to hit some stunning acidic high notes, and the finish - after a burst of sweetness - recedes into a unique, oddly cooling aftershock. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s far from perfect, but its character is thoroughly agreeable despite its flaws.|
|HomeBarGirl| |AGRICOLEEEEEEEEEEE. PLANTS! PLANTS! PLANTS! PLANTS! Loads of minerals. Is this from Haiti or perhaps Marie Galante (Nah, there wouldn‚Äö be bits in it from MG).|red fruity, funky planty, yes, yes, yes, yes. I love this. Getting some kind of weird vanilla and light aging notes? Is this new Spirit of Haiti Velier Clairin aged at Berling?|Um, there are bits in this Rum. BLACK BITS. What is this unfiltered shit I am putting in my body? Haha. This must be from Haiti? Haha. I love it.|
|Anxst|Grassy. Taffy. Lime leaves, cotton candy, faint rubber.|A rush of alcoholic sugar. Charred plastic, chemicals, grassy sweetness, burnt marshmallow.|Splenda and mown hay.|Too artificial tasting for me, did not enjoy.|
|xreekinghavocx|differently sour than seven - more like a geuze but also like a compost bin, very CO2 heavy, some kind of jellied fruit candy|taste is like the smell of some kind of incense - jasmine?, jalapeno, light sourness again, sugar cubes|geuze again|enjoyable, but like 7, seems too odd for a pick we would all feel proud of|
|Texacer|asphalt, funk, tropical, cumin, sour|sour sugar, decay, bittersweet, wood|too long|not a fan|

WearableBliss,ep2y0f,1,rum,Rum with very long finishes,"I am by no means a rum expert but I think I surveyed the landscape efficiently to get a reasonable idea what flavour profiles are out there, and I was pretty convinced the foursquare one is the one for me and I could not get enough of this ""christmassu bourbon"" that is the exceptional cask series.

However, I recently came across two experiences that made me question that a bit, and that my favourite might still be undiscovered.

I had an El Dorado 21 and Dictator 26 Cask strength single cask that both were soft and delicious and especially had a finish so long I could really see myself enjoying it all evening. Very different beast from the other rums that I enjoy where the point is that they hit you over the head mid-palate. Now obviously I could just buy either of those bottles but the former stands a bit against my no added sugar high abv, age statement etc ideology the latter is really expensive. 

So i was wondering if my description resonates with anyone or if anyone has advice what to explore in this area.",13,2020-01-15 22:25:19

BrianRampage,epdydq,1,rum,Review #16 - Rum Malecon Reserva Imperial 25yr,"**Review #16 - Rum Malecon Reserva Imperial 25yr**

**25 years in oak, 80pf Panamanian rum made ""in traditional Cuban style""(?), approx $70/750mL**

(There's very little info I could find, background-wise, on this bottle from a very half-assed search, so I'm going to guess there isn't much availability of this in the States.  Malecon releases a ton of aged expressions - 3yr, 5yr, 8yr, 10yr, 12yr, 13yr, 15yr, 18yr, 20yr, 21yr, and 25yr, so I'm not entirely sure what the hell they're doing, and being as that I'm not fluent in spanish, I have no idea what's on this label.  I'm just going to assume is roughly translates to ""Papi Van Winkle"".)

**Highlights** - despite being diluted down to 80pf, this is still a sexy bourbon-y medium-dark brown.  Complex on the palate/finish

**Lowlights** - Confusing profile on the palate; it's incredibly dry, tastes like it aged in a tired barrel

**A Few Tasting Notes** - unsweetened black tea, rose petals, dehydrated pineapple, almonds, mint

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - Plantation Xaymaca, Zacapa 23

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This** - Novo Fogo Gold

**Overall** - **53/100**.  I hate grading this as low as I am.   Not because it doesn't deserve it, but because it's honestly not a terrible product, it just couldn't be further from my wheelhouse and what I enjoy in a rum.   I **detest** unsweetened black tea, and I unfortunately can't get that thought out of my head when I'm drinking it.   It had a decent amount of complexity, that you'd expect from a 25yr old product, but the notes just do not jive with me at all, and it needs some proof.  I could see some people really enjoying this, but not me.  Cheers.",3,2020-01-16 12:02:16

It's a blend of mostly demerera and some jamaican rum iirc... would an el dorado 12 or 15 maybe cut it?

henryb22,esy2au,1,rum,Martinique travel recommendations,"So within the last year or so have become a big rum fan via tiki and my wife and I have decided on Martinique for a late April/early May vacation for a number of reasons, r(h)um being one of them. I have read all the associated threads here and done a lot of internet research but wanted some general recommendations as I know many people here have traveled there.

Going for a week and most likely will stay in an Airbnb probably in Les Trois ilets but might also split our time somewhere else, maybe the north? Does anyone have recommendations on where to stay? We will be renting a car for the whole time.

Distilleries-Will definitely be hitting Rhum JM, Habitation Cl√©ment and Neisson but open to more (wife dependent, though she in general likes that stuff). Was thinking Depaz and maybe St James? I have just gotten my first bottle of rhum agricole (Rhum JM VSOP and Smith and cross make an excellent mai tai) so I don‚Äôt know a lot but want to learn more. 

Bottles to buy-Seems a 55% Blanc is a must buy, trois rivi√®res or Cl√©ment. What else? Not a big rum/liquor neat guy but could get into it. Typically I make cocktails. 

And finally other recommendations (restaurants/bars/things to do)-will definitely be hiking Mt Pelee, going to several beaches (Anse dufuor, Anse noir, Plage ded salines, others?) maybe Caravelle nature walk, cayoneering? Probably spend half a day or so in Fort De France and we sill definitely be going to Le Petitbonum. It seems several of the distilleries have restaurants that are quite good so will probably eat there too. Open to any siggestion!

Sorry for the long post, TIA!",20,2020-01-24 03:31:31

I've been looking through lots of posts and everyone is saying to stay away from anything Jamaican since it is too funky. He is an avid whiskey drinker, loves scotch, and bourbon. Some of his favorites that I know of are Yamazaki 12&amp;18, Balvenie 14&amp;15 Kavalan Port Solist, Angel's Envy Rye, Highland Park, and 1792 full proof to get an idea for flavor profile. We just came back from the Bahamas and had Papas Pilar from the distillery and we enjoyed it. But neither of us have really gotten into sipping rum. So I'm looking for something that is nice to start with that isn't dosed. Something to sip and sit on. Cost isn't really an issue, but I'm not looking to break the bank.

BrianRampage,eu24y2,1,rum,Rum Review #17 (Network #156) - Smith &amp; Cross Jamaica Rum,"**Rum Review #17 (Network #156) - Smith &amp; Cross Traditional Jamaica Rum** - 57% ABV ""Navy Strength"", pure pot still molasses (Wedderburn and Plummer), NAS, no chill filtration ~$35/750mL**

**Highlights** - despite how it burns nasally, it honestly drinks at proof or easier; after a *lot* of air time, the nose calms down a little, gets kind of chocolately

**Lowlights** - absolutely unforgiving on the nose, I feel like they typo'd the label and it should have been 75% ABV instead of 57; this is going to be too ester-forward for most inexperienced rum drinkers

**A Few Tasting Notes** - loads of esters, cheap armagnac (not necessarily a bad thing), orange peel, pipe tobacco, nutmeg

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - Rhum Barbancourt 8yr/Star, Rhum J.M. VSOP

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This** - Doctor Bird,  Rhum Barbancourt 4yr/3 Star

**Overall** - **68/100** - As far as my Jamaican journey has gone so far (not terribly far), this is the new champ.   The Doctor Bird I was A/B'ing against this pales in comparison, though the profiles are fairly unique between them despite their specs.  I'm too lazy to get into mixology/tiki drinks, but I've got to believe that this is going to deliver on any recipe that calls for proof and pungency. With that being said, it's a little rough neat - but that's honestly an expectation for a 114pf spirit.  It's funky in its own way without being too much ""rotten banana"", and possesses a complexity that belies the tradition of most NAS spirits.  This pour has depth on the palate with a warm finish, and would probably score much higher if I were rating on any scale other than how it is neat.",6,2020-01-26 12:31:43

I picked up a bottle of Appleton Estate Reserve Blend since I've never had a Jamaican rum before, and I gotta say, I'm pretty surprised. I always thought that rum had to be sweet, but this almost isn't sweet at all? It's closer to some whiskies that I've had than almost any of the rums I've had before.

666moist,ecv1k7,1,rum,Think I'm finally ready for some recommendations.,"**Preface**

Coming from a whisky background, been meaning to explore rum deeper for a long time and finally got around to starting.  I've also spent a ton of time on the various whisky subreddits, so I've seen my share of unhelpful recommendation requests; I'll do my best not to be one of those, but if I leave anything out, let me know and I'll edit this post.

-----

**INB4** 

Yes I'm aware of the guide in the sidebar.  I've read it several times, as well as gone through many many posts on this sub.  I have begun to assemble a list of rums I want to try, which I'll put at the end of this post, but I'm looking for any changes, additions, or even just which ones on it to prioritize.  Looking for sippers, neat; secondarily maybe something on the cheaper side to experiment with blending into whiskies or maybe mixing cocktails.  Definitely want to stick to aged rums, but am open to any and all styles/regions, though it seems I tend to prefer the Spanish, column-still ones *so far*.  

Whisky-wise, I mostly stay within scotch and bourbon, and enjoy almost all styles therein (except for overly-fruity, non-sherried Speysides), all finishes (love port especially), and all levels of peat.  

-----

**Rums I've Really Enjoyed**

* Brugal 1888 (love the slight sherry influence)
* Privateer Distiller's Drawer - Queen's Share (barrel pick, absolutely mind-blowing)
* Don Q A√±ejo (enjoyed this one so much I suspect I may have accidentally been given the Gran A√±ejo--or it's just that good, idk)
* Zacapa 23 (except for the super artificial finish, which bugged me a bit)
* Rhum J.M. Gold

**Rums I Did Not Enjoy**

* Dos Maderas 5+5 (WAY too sickly sweet for me)
* Barbancourt 3 Star (4 yr age statement)
* Smith &amp; Cross (not sure I'm ready for that much funk)

**Other Rums I've Had and Moderately Enjoyed**

* Pusser's British Navy
* Zaya Gran Reserva
* Mount Gay Black Barrel
* Bacardi 8
* Brugal A√±ejo

-----

*Tentative To-drink List So Far*

* Flor de Ca√±a 12/18
* Mount Gay XO
* El Dorado 15
* Barbancourt 5 Star
* Appleton 12
* Doorly's 12
* Clement VSOP
* Hamilton 151
* Plantation OFTD
* Some Foursquare or something - I'm still confused about all their releases",34,2019-12-19 23:54:02

BrianRampage,ed3bk8,1,rum,"Reviews 7-8: Mount Gay Black Barrel and Doorly's 12yr, SBS","**Reviews 7-8: Mount Gay Black Barrel vs Doorly's 12**

**Preface** - Seems reasonable to compare a couple of Barbadosian/Barbadian/Bajan/whatever rums that both appear on [""Tarquin's What Should I Buy? Guide""](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/c9vqvr/tarquins_unofficial_rrum_what_should_i_buy_guide/), and I love padding my review stats, so let's go. 

-----

**Mount Gay Black Barrel - 43% ABV, NAS, Barbados rum finished in ex-bourbon, ~$25 USD**

**Highlights** - sweet brown sugar/raisin nose

**Lowlights** - not a ton of rum character - the bourbon influence wants dominate the pour

**A Few Tasting Notes** - vanilla, oak, fig, lemon zest 

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - Doorly's 12yr

**Pours I've Like a Little Less Than This** - Doctor Bird Jamaican Rum, Doorly's 8yr

**Overall** - **64/100**  Feels like another great entry into the rum world for a bourbon enthusiast.   Like most other rums I've reviewed, it would've benefited from a proof increase.  As is, it's *super smooth* and drinkable neat.  I'm not confident this could stand up in a cocktail, but it's smooth sailing neat.  Would serve as an elite ""well"" rum for a home bar.

-----

**Doorly's 12yr - Barbados rum partially-aged in ex-Madeira, 12 year, 40% ABV, ~$27 USD, Total Wine (&amp; More) exclusive**

**Highlights** - soft, rounded, and balanced on the palate between the oaky vanilla bourbon influence and the sweet rum backbone

**Lowlights** - weak, neutered nose

**A Few Tasting Notes** - caramel, cigar smoke

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - N/A; Maybe Plantation 5yr

**Pours I've Like a Little Less Than This** - Mount Gay Black Barrel, Doorly's 8yr

**Overall** - **66/100** I'd love to wax poetic on how good this is, but I can't help but think of how truly good it would be at cask strength.. or even at 100pf..  or 90pf... regardless, at 80 proof, this is still a solid dram, and *yet another*(TM) excellent entry into the rum world for a bourbon drinker such as myself.  It makes perfect sense that this is a sub darling and on the rec list.

---

Continuing the thematic SBS nature of my reviews, the nod clearly goes to Doorly's 12 here, though there's no shame for the Black Barrel camp.  You wouldn't go wrong giving either of these a shot coming from the bourbon world.",5,2019-12-20 10:00:25

BrianRampage,e0l8rm,1,rum,Reviews #3-4: Aficionado's XXX/Two and XXX/Three SBS,"**Reviews 3-4: Aficionado's XXX/Two and XXX/Three SBS**

**Preface:**

I can wait no longer. It's college football Saturday, the Hoosiers are inexplicably 7-3 and I need to pregame right.   I'm still a rum scrub, but I've sipped enough local faves (Doorly's 8/XO, Dr. Bird, Plantation 5/Xaymaca, Foursquare Zin, Zacapa 23 lol) to get a baseline on rum profiles.  I have a mini each of these picks, and I need to find out if I need to buy a bottle (or more) before they sell out. Let's go, Hoosiers by 15.

-----

**Aficionado's XXX/Two - 14yr Venezuelan dark rum matured in french oak, then finished in ex-rum, 59.3%ABV, NCF/NCA/No sugar added**

**Highlights** - deep oak nose; a lovely sweet/spicy/coating finish, pretty easy to sip neat for ~120pf

**Lowlights** - slightly sour entry into the palate

**A Few Tasting Notes** - oak, butterscotch

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - XXX/Three

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This** - Foursquare Zinfandel Finish

Two is a tricky beast.  On a superficial level, it smells like an old oaky bourbon (like Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, EC18, or Rhetoric), but if you hunt, you can find some hidden sweet rummy goodness.  Consumed neat, the palate is muddled, probably most likely due to the proof.  This is a bourbon drinker's dream rum. **80/100**  Despite my general small complaints, this is a no-brainer for purchase for the specs/price/uniqueness/value.

-----

**XXX/Three - Dominican Rep dark rum, roughly 9ish years (between 5 years in first-fill bourbon, steel vatting, then 4 years in ex-rum), 62.4%ABV, NCF/NCA/No sugar added

**Highlights** - Beautiful, traditional/tropical nose; bright and clean on the palate

**Lowlights** - it's only 3% higher ABV than the /Two, but drinks noticeably hotter (but again, at 124 proof, what else am I really supposed to expect here), I would've liked maybe a tad bit more oak, but that's personal preference, and I'm an oakophile.

**A Few Tasting Notes** - coconut, brown sugar

**Pours I've Slightly Preferred to This** - N/A

**Pours I've Liked a Little Less Than This** - XXX/Two

Again, I've had limited exposure and my rum journey is just getting started, but I think this is the best rum I've had so far.  It's an unsweetened, low funk rum with all the dials turned up to 11.  It lacks a little complexity towards the finish. I think this would be an amazing mixer or a great sip-and-think.  Probably would be too dangerous and wasteful to butt-chug, though. **83/100** - an incredible value for an aged, cask-strength rum.  I'm getting a bottle.  Or two. Or */Three*.  (plays the Price Is Right Fail trombone sound)

---

**Final Thoughts** - Two picks with very different personalities.  I wouldn't feel great mixing with Two unless you're subbing in rum for bourbon in something like a Rum Old Fashioned that will play well with oak - it seems better served as a sipping rum.  It'd be the perfect gateway to/from the bourbon world.  I think Three is much more versatile and vibrant, and more representative of the true essence of rum (no uncommon maturation casks or finishing/added sugar/etc).   I think the Aficionados squad knocked it out of the park on both of these, though I'd *slightly* skew towards the Three on days where I'm looking for ""a rum"". Cheers!",3,2019-11-24 01:46:43

WearableBliss,e2yizo,1,rum,Foursquare 'vertical' review,"I was getting into peated single malt and bourbon when I randomly bought a bottle of foursquare 2005 (I believe thanks to Ralphy on youtube) and it massively turned me onto rum. Very much unlike whisky, where I even after tasted hundreds cannot really say I would consider myself a fan of a certain distillery, or even a single expression (although Buffalo Trace and Springbank perform possibly better on aggregate than others), I was really converted to a Foursquare fan and bought 11 different bottles of them almost before exploring anything else in the rum world. I have to say also what got me into was that you can get some of the best stuff in the world for a bit lower prices than whisky but looking at the prices here I am actually not so sure that is true, between 55-90 you can get most of the very good staples of the whisky world too.

&amp;#x200B;

**2005**:

I am doing this one first because to me it is the baseline.

If I had to find whisky parallels I would say it is something like a Laphroaig Quarter Cask, Macallan 12 or Weller Antique, it is balanced and rich yet focused on a particular message it wants to deliver and it does so with little distraction. There are no unpleasant notes in here you need to tolerate in order to get the main delivery. This message to me is a Christmassy nutmeg, clove, sugar taste that many friends who tasted this said did not even seem like rum to them. I could not plausibly see how anyone who likes whisky would not like this and many friends who said ""I don't like rum"" I told ""you may have never had rum"". An eye-opener for me that made me want to understand the Foursquare range.

**2004**: I would say it is exactly like 2005 just that the specific clove Christmas taste comes on much earlier, it is there on the arrival and less towards the finish. I don't knot why but it is a consistent observation. It is slightly less sweet and full and round and seductive as the 2005 if you put them side by side.

**2007**: Actually a bit different, the Christmassy flavour is more distributed, it seems less one dimensional and more diffuse. But not really better, I enjoy being hit in the face by the nutmeg/cloves. (I read the 2007 has a higher pot still component than the previous years, explaining how it is the odd one out, out of the 3). It is more complex and less sweet, especially if you taste the pure potstill (below) you can sort of see why.

All 3 are great, good price (¬£55), although maybe some of them seem to get sold out, I am not worried about stockpiling I would be excited to buy the new vintage every year of this series. These also work with an old fashioned or even in a sour, they still carry their big flavour through (at this price point also tolerable to not drink neat). I have blended a small amount of the 2004/2005/2007 together and it was very good too but seemed to converge to be more like the 2007.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hereditas** (¬£80)

Again which the whisky metaphor this feels like a Distiller's Edition or Laphroaig Triple Wood, if you feel you understand the straight forward message of the classic, the sherry finish takes it up a level, it adds a richer yet more confusing undertow and obscures the clear hook. But that is a not a bad thing. In a direct comparison, this sherry syrup makes something like the 2004 seem a bit thin.

It is much more like the 2007 in that it does not have a specific moment in which you get the clove/Christmas punch in the face. I did wonder if you could add some sherry to the 2007 and let it sit for a bit and maybe recreate part of this experience. So I tried it, and while it was delicious it's own way I am glad to say it was not the same at all, way more acidic and fresh fruity rather than dark stewed fruits.

This one is my favourite so far, also the one of my guests, although I can't really say it is a steal for ¬£80. Might pick up a backup if I am let down a bit by Patrimonio but I am worried Hereditas will sell out before I have a special occasion to open Patrimonio.

**Dominus** (¬£55)

A lot like the 2004/5/7 but I would say dryer and more tannic in the finish, consistent with the cask I suppose. Overall very in the mainstream of Foursquare. On paper it looks similar to Plantation XO but put them side by side and see how this outclasses the sweetened Plantation by a mile.

**Habitation Velier 2013 to 2015** (¬£85):

I had to buy this after reading the review of the very influential to me  [u/Tarquin\_Underspoon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tarquin_Underspoon/).

There are two key things here, this is pot still only while the rest is a blend of column and pot. Also it is only aged for 2 years (in cognac casks though which are presumably powerful). This one is clearly less value for money (85¬£) and more of a risk however I was so curious about what the building blocks are of the standard Foursquare. This is basically their single malt equivalent, with less wood influence at that. Rarely was I as excited to open a bottle.

It is very different indeed. savoury, complex, reminders of Agricole and Jamaican styles, Olives and Banana. I have no idea how this even is a component in the 2004/2005/2007 series (this confusion I felt was actually foreshadowed in the review by Tarquin\_Underspoon that lead me to buy this). I was expecting it to reveal a part of the construction of the blend but it doesn't, and it makes me really curious if it was ever possible to try a Foursquare pure column still (the Nikka Coffey Malt is a banger, so I'd say there is nothing wrong with column stills). This profits from some water in my opinion.

But overall I cannot say that it is as delicious and all-encompassing as the Hereditas (also, ff you like this sort of thing, something like Hampden Overproof can take you much further in the funky direction, possibly too far). I am sure the real rum experts who this is targeted at enjoy it a lot but it would not be my first recommendation. However after tasting the similarity of all he other Foursquare releases this one can be an absolute joy and refreshing, salty and complex and weird.  Coming back to this after a few months I wonder if this one could end up being my favourite one day though.

**Spiced** (¬£27):

So this is obviously unsurprisingly different, spices, half the price, 37% ABV. I would say it does taste like the 2004/5/7 if you a. add cinnamon, b. add lots of water, c. add an unpleasant metallic note. So in terms of sipping I would not recommend this, however, I tried it as an old fashioned or sour and it is great. For a Sour maybe on its own, for an old fashioned I'd make add some Spiced and a little 2004/5/7 for extra oomph. It is interesting that I realize now tasting explicitly flavoured alcohol, how interesting and subtle and refined the flavours of rum and whisky are, to evoke cinnamon or clove, without there being any of these flavours actually added.

**Veritas** (¬£35):

A mix Foursquare Column and Hampden Pot, clear, oily, fresh and strange. Not made for sipping although its interesting to sip, this one really holds together and shines in a mixed drink. The olive funkiness really goes well together with the acidity and sugar of a cocktail. Could be a bit cheaper I suppose for that purpose.

**Velvet Falernum (¬£14)**:

Not bad but I could not quite get it to work yet, corn and oil as a cocktail can not live up to the neat class of the pure spirits. 

Finally, I have an unopened Premise and am uncertain whether to add Sagacity and Empery as they both have been described as more dry, and if I wanted more it honestly would go into the 2007 or habitation velier direction. I tried two single barrel options at SMWS, wanted to buy R6.2 but they were out so I took R6.1, still unopened. Tasted a lot like the Habitation Velier although it's 14 years, I wonder if it is full pot still, they could not say for sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I think maybe level 2 of whisky appreciation is going online and reading reviews and buying well reviewed bottles. But that means that for limited releases you are playing catch-up and pay the high price after the community has settled on what the winners are. And of course, many special releases are all snapped up by experts within days of hitting the shelves before any reviews are available. So a higher level is clearly to know which producers you trust and buy the new or special releases the moment they become available, blind, and be the one to review them first. I may never get to that point with whisky but with Foursquare I just might.

I would predict I will keep on buying the exceptional cask series especially the finished ones.  I have an unopened Patrimonio for a special occasion and a Premise for when I reduced the number of open bottles. It is also interesting that Exceptional Cask Series is quite cheap in the UK compared to the Velier/FS and Habitation FS releases, so that is probably where one should pay attention.

I am not sure if I will venture as deeply in the Foursquare Velier releases between 150 and 250¬£. I cannot quite see how that could be worth it but I am open to having my mind changed. It seems to me the price difference there is not solely driven by fundamentals. The bottles do look amazing though.

It feels good to be a fan of something, it's not something you get to do a lot as an adult.",5,2019-11-28 22:13:35

None of it is rum.

I never liked rum, or at least I never liked what I tried. Kraken, coconut Malibu, Bacardi, etc. I am trying to change that, and I thought trying to make tiki drinks would be a good start.

Well it turns out tiki drinks are far more complex than your average gin or vodka based cocktail, and nearly every one requires DIYing something. I've made my own simple syrup (and honey mix, and ginger syrup, etc) and grenadine for years, but so far falernum and orgeat are outside my comfort zone.

So here it is, [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13OyJm8PCqEECobfTa9OIPHMTECVH8EHcErmUIwyC6vI/edit?usp=sharing), sorted vertically by rum base, then citrus, then other ingredients, and with the rums ordered by number of cocktails each rum is used in out of the 14 recommended in the [Minimalist Tiki blog post](https://cocktailwonk.com/2015/07/minimalist-tiki-what-you-truly-need-to-make-the-classics-at-home.html). Sorted horizontally by easiest to make given the user buys the rums that are used the most often first. That sounds confusing, but the checkboxes should make it visually easy to understand.

I live in Colorado, a doubly landlocked state that is winter half the year, and perhaps that is why I'm having so much trouble finding rums better than bottom shelf garbage. The only bar that serves tiki drinks is an hour away from me so I can't even taste any ""real"" rums before buying them.

Do you have suggestions for me? Am I giving the minimalist tiki author too much ethos in only reading his recs for what kind of rums and what specific bottles to start with? Are the crappy rums I can find good enough to start with or are they truly utter trash that will keep me thinking I dislike rum and rum based cocktails?",30,2019-12-06 03:22:58

I just discovered that I'm thoroughly enjoying sipping white rums but got an issue with that. I have no idea what's good.

However, it was offered to me when visiting France and now that I'm back in the US, it seems there is an embargo on French rhums or simply, no market for them. 
Would you guys have recommendations on rums that are ""easily"" available in the US and smooth enough to be sipped like La Digue?",32,2019-10-11 00:41:23

I poured some out for myself and a friend, and we both hated it. Everywhere I look online describes it tasting of vanilla, toffee, chocolate, fruits, etc. But when we tried it neither of us tasted any of that, just a strong taste of alcohol by itself.

It's not an issue of not being accustomed to drinking rum straight, I quite enjoyed drinking Kraken (yes I know, everyone here hates spiced rum for some reason), and I could handle it fine and taste the flavours.

I tried diluting it with ice to mellow out the alcoholic flavour, but it still didn't reveal any of the other flavours people praise it for.

Over the last few years, I've taken my rum 'hobby' to what I would say is a fairly committed level. I'm now deep in the world of cask strength massive hogo bombs and rare Demarara's and I love it. I'm a big believer that the journey you take with spirits discovery is all part of the fun, hence why I never recommend people dive straight into the Veliers if they've only just discovered Ron Zacapa. It's important to get that education and discover what you like.

I've held off on Agricoles for a long time (The closest I've got to Agricole is the Velier Clarins), but I would like to start exploring this side of rum now.

On that note, I'd love some recommendations on some good places to start, perhaps something that makes for delicious easy drinking along with some wild tasting experiences.  I do prefer higher ABV spirits. 

Unleash your knowledge

So over this past weekend i was introduced to the finer side of rum, having only had basic experience with Bacardi in drinks, i tried out a few different brands straight, and was really surprised at how much i liked it. 

My favorite was a bottle of 23 Zacapa, which i found to be very tasty and in no way as sweet as a few of the other brands i tried. 

So now i am looking for suggestions on types and brands of Rum that are not sweet, but more of a dry Rum i guess, as the sweet ones is not as much in my taste. 

Hopefully someone here can give me few suggestions before i head out as to what brands to look for ?",7,2019-10-17 20:18:33

I promptly visited five different stores and bought eight bottles.

Recently I've discovered they either brought it back or found a limited stash. I was able to buy another ten. I may now have a stockpile but am still reserving these for special occasions.

I also have a single bottle of Ron Cartavio XO which I have not yet opened because I've been unable to locate any additional ones for sale - but have only heard good things. I would like to try and not drink this until I could line up a replacement or there's a very special occasion.

I've just opened a bottle of Plantation XO 20th Anniversary because I've been able to confirm I can find and buy more and was I ever pleasantly surprised. It's really smooth.

Ron Zacappa is another I enjoy, much easier to locate and purchase. Because of that this has become my most frequent bottle and it's certainly not, by any means, shabby.

As the title suggests, I'm curious to hear the rankings from someone who has tried all of the rums above, as well as to hear from any who might have suggestions as to similar rums which might be easier to procure.",5,2019-10-27 03:51:31

I'm looking for something that is similar, but better, and less than $50 (I'm still in school). Ideally, it would be very smooth/tasty without anything mixed in (good for sipping). I have heard Zaya might be better, but also that they may have changed their recipe from the one that was critically acclaimed 3-4 years ago.

stormstatic,d5gaou,68,rum,Can we talk about how some users react when folks bring up sugar content?,"Hoping for some thoughtful meta-discussion here.

The following is a fairly frequent exchange in this sub:

&gt; 1. OP posts photo/tasting notes/review of rums like Zacapa 23, El Dorado 15, Bumbu, Don Papa, etc. Maybe they're new to rum, maybe they've been guzzling the stuff for decades ‚Äì regardless, they enjoy these rums.

&gt; 2. Other users reply to point out the added sugar, [link to the two] (http://thefatrumpirate.com/hydrometer-tests-2) most common [sets of hydrometer tests](http://drecon.dk/index.php/17-list-of-rum-measured), suggest OP check out rum from Barbados, Jamaica, Martinique if they're interested in trying rum in a more pure form ‚Äì¬†that is, without added sugar. I'm often the one to do this, and almost always include some form of ""drink what you enjoy, but know what you're drinking"", alluding to the fact that *many* people do not realize how much sugar is in what they're drinking. This comment often also contains something about lack of transparency in labeling.

&gt; 3. A different set of users chime in with comments like ""ignore the sugar purists"", ""don't listen to the pretentious rum snobs"", and ""let OP drink what they want to drink"". They point out that sugar and additives have been added to rum since time immemorial, not to mention that such well-regarded spirits as Tequila and Cognac also allow for additives.

&gt; 4. What could have been an educational read for OP turns into the standard rum-purist vs. sugar-agnostic shouting match for a while with all the usual arguments being made.

While I'm certainly biased in my thoughts here as someone who might be considered a ""purist"" when it comes to rum, is it just me who sees the comments pointing out sugar as helpful, educational, and resourceful, while the comments essentially saying ""ignore the people talking about sugar"" are argumentative, unnecessary, and contentious?

I don't judge people or make assumptions about them based on they choose to drink, whether it's rum that is essentially a liqueur, Tequila with additives and glycerin, or Cognac full of [bois√©](https://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2012/1/22/france-day-6-to-boise-or-not-to-boise.html). My aim in bringing up sugar dosage and additives in rum is to inform, educate, and allow folks to make their own decisions and interpretations based on facts. The people who tend to enter the fold after this is brought up are just making things less clear for those who aren't aware and may seek to learn about what they're drinking.

I dunno, just my two cents. Thoughts?",108,2019-09-17 20:31:14

But I'm a little skeptical that a brand such as Captain would be able to cheaply produce a rum similar to Wray and Nephew with an authentically produced funk. 

I am wondering if maybe manufactured esters were added to a cheap column still rum to attempt to recreate a pot still flavor/aroma, such ethyl acetate or other similarly fruity, aromatic esters.

Hunting down rum is a difficult battle. People make it sound like if I want a specific brand I have to basically go to the distillery or somewhere coastal nearby. In the midwestern US where I'm at, liquor stores have a selection 75% comprised of giant lines of flavored Bacardi and Malibu, and a side shelf devoted to everything else. Retailers haven't heard of El Dorado Plantation, Hamilton, Lemon Hart, or overproof rums in general outside of Smith &amp; Cross and the now discontinued Bacardi 151.  Even the Total Wine I can feasibly go to every few months only stands out with Plantation 3 star and 5 year. I feel as though this is a shared sentiment for many of us regardless of specific location. If there are online resources outside of looking up every individual place and going there or going through 10's of futile phone calls I'm all ears. I haven't seen people on here sharing woes the way I am now before so I feel like I'm missing out on resources, and most definitely knowledge in general.

TL;DR I'm in the midwest US, and I have no clue where I can go for rum. I am aware of a Total Wine but it's a 4 hour drive to Minneapolis.",18,2019-09-26 10:09:00

BestRectumInTheWest,cuthpn,6,rum,I bought my first bottle of 'decent' rum the other day - El Dorado 12 year old. What do others think of this drop? How does it compare with other 'good' rums?,"Personally, I think it's great. I'm not gonna go on with the pretentious, ""hints of this"" and ""overtones of that"" nonsense - it tastes of demerara sugar and strong oak (like in whiskey) to me. Like a cheap rum but more refined. 

I have nothing really to compare it with, apart from my usual Inner Circle offerings. It's kind of like that but ""thicker"" for want of a better word.

What do other people say? Is this rum ""good""? Average? Complete crap? Looking for input so that I can make a more informed choice, next time.",13,2019-08-24 21:38:13

BattletoadRash,cuup65,4,rum,Rum Choice for a Dr. Funk,"I like absinthe in cocktails, so I want to find a go-to Dr. Funk recipe for my home bar. Researching between Smuggler's Cove, Beachbum Berry Remixed, and various internet sources, it seems there are two primary schools of thought on the rum choice here.

Older versions used light Puerto Rican rum (I'm assuming to really highlight the absinthe), newer versions use Dark Jamaican rum to better stand up to the absinthe. I see Hamilton's Pot Still Black recommended for the Jamaican route. 

I do like the look of clear rums in this drink, but a drink called ""Dr. Funk"" should have at least some funk flavor, right? Enter W&amp;N Overproof... checks both boxes :)

I see a couple options here... 1) a full 2oz of W&amp;N for a high-proof version, 2) go 50/50 W&amp;N + a neutral white rum for a tamed down version, or 3) go 50/50 W&amp;N + S&amp;C for a full funk version without changing the coloring too much. Option 2 seems like a good way to split the difference between the original recipe and the Jamaican style. 

Any thoughts on this approach? Will break out the shakers here in a bit.",5,2019-08-24 23:23:21

Good morning r/rum, Happy Labor Day!

As 2019 is well underway, there are no doubt many exciting things going on in the Reddit Whiskey communities. I am happy to bring you an update regarding a follow up to r/rum's XXX:One rum selection from earlier this year. 

Generally, the selection was well received. Personally, I loved it. It was a ton of fun to do, and many people requested we continue the project. I'm happy to let you know that has become a reality. In about 3 weeks, two more releases will arrive to accompany XXX:One. It's with great excitement that today I get to reveal XXX:Two and XXX:Three to the r/rum community, and the internet abroad.

While we did XXX:One as a single cask, a single selection picked from a round of blinded samples from FineDrams, we decided to up the ante this time around. Working with the always awesome FineDrams, we got the authorization to pick two casks, provided they were liked enough. With this information, I gathered the tasting panel, but kept them in the dark. Pick the best rums, I told them. Alongside myself and Jonas from FineDrams, several people joined me.

- [/u/texacer](https://reddit.com/u/texacer) : A Wisconsin native involved with XXX:one. He's a standout member of the whiskey, rum and gin communities. Alongside him was
- [/u/rustypipes](https://reddit.com/u/rustypipes) : a long time boozebag with years of industry experience. His rum collection makes me weep with joy. Also involved in XXX:Two
- [/u/teejaydub](https://reddit.com/u/teejaydub) : A member of the Reddit communities, and also a designer from XXX:One.
- [/u/g-list](https://reddit.com/u/g-list) : Rum nerd of the highest degree (agave, too)
- [/u/xreekinghavocx](https://reddit.com/u/xreekinghavocx) : Another prolific member of the spirits communities with a passion for reviews
- [/u/scotch_fanatic](https://reddit.com/u/scotch_fanatic) : Jonas, owner of FineDrams. A passionate shop owner who loves the selection process and enables us to do cool shit like this, time and time again. 

While Reddit made XXX:one very tough as they rolled out their new TOS, it took some work to conduct all of this above the boards. Thankfully, we were able to make it work, and FineDrams will again be handling all ordering and fulfillment, as they are licensed to do so. 

-----

##The Tasting

So, with our panel set, it was time to taste. The panel received 10 samples of 10 different rums. It was a goal to not repeat XXX:One, so we deliberately excluded casks from Barbados. Other than that, the panel (myself included) was completely in the dark. Ten samples can take a bit of work to get through, so most tasters took several days to go through the set multiple times. They took great notes and turned them into me, and I did all of the analysis. Of the ten samples, there was a lot of great info collected. 

At the end of the day there were two standout samples. Nothing faired poorly, as this was a great sample set overall, but two samples almost unanimously stole away the show.

|Sample|t8ke|texacer|rustypipes|tjw|g-list|phillycesarthreejag|scotch_fanatc|
--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1||2nd|||1st|||

|8|1st|1st|3rd|1st|3rd|1st||
|9|3rd|10th||10th||10th|3rd|
|10|||10th|||||

Overall, this looks like so when you sum the points (lower = better) and compare the sample deviations:

|Sample|Sum Points|Deviation|
--:|--:|--:|
|1|22|4|
|2|36|8|
|3|44|3|

|5|35|8|
|6|47|6|
|7|34|8|
|8|14|3|
|9|44|7|

And here are the word clouds for each sample to give you a feel of some of the most prominent notes that were taken down by tasters:

So, this data pretty clearly illustrates how overwhelmingly two samples stood out. Sample 1 and Sample 8 were standouts, but we were dying to know what we had tasted. Therefore, it was time to get some reveals. 

## The Reveals

After all of the notes were in, reveals were releases. They were SUPER interesting. Let's take a look: 

|Sample ID|Origin|Mark|Distillation Month|Distillation Year|Distillery|Maturation|ABV|Yield (700 ml bottle)|Price Estimate (EUR)|Price Estimate (USD)|
--:|:--|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|1|Dominican Republic|MDR5|December|2010|Alcoholes Finos Dominicanos|Bourbon|63|272|41.6|47|
|2|Guyana|MDS (Coloured)|April|2008|Diamond|Bourbon|65|241|52|58.8|
|3|Australia|MAIC10|August|2007|N/A (Inner Circle Rum, based on the last two letters of the mark?)|Bourbon|69|269|61.6|69.6|
|4|Guyana|MPM|May|2005|Diamond (Port Mourant)|Bourbon|59|205|63.2|71.4|
|5|Guyana|MDSL (Coloured)|December|2003|Diamond|Bourbon|59|205|62.4|70.5|
|6|Trinidad|TML|January|2010|Trinidad Distillers Limited|Bourbon|66|259|46.4|52.4|
|7|Trinidad|TML|February|2003|Trinidad Distillers Limited|Bourbon|61|304|63.2|71.4|
|8|Venezuela|MVCDF|April|2005|Corporacion Alcoholes Del Caribe S.A.|Bourbon / French Oak|60|273|56.8|64.2|
|9|Guyana|MPM|April|2008|Diamond (Port Mourant)|Bourbon|60|261|48.8|55.1|
|10|Trinidad|TML|January|2007|Trinidad Distillers Limited|Bourbon|68|252|55.2|62.4|

Wow, lots of weird stuff in there. Sample 8, the most favored, is a Venezuelan rum. That's something I never expected to pick, especially against contenders like Guyana and Trinidad, but that's the asset of blind reviewing, and the other reviews experienced the same excitement. On Day 1, Jonas told me we should pick two casks if we found two we liked enough. I kept this between him and I until after reveals. I asked the others if they thought we should take two if we could, and it was unanimously a yes. There was some contention between 1 and 8, so it was a joy that we would get to have both. As such, I'm happy to officially announce that XXX:Two will be a Venezuelan Rum from Corporacion Alcoholes Del Caribe S.A. and XXX:Three will be a Dominican Rum from Alcoholes Finos Dominicanos. 

With this information, it was time to make the order. Jonas asked that we make a public release when the casks were confirmed and delivered, as sometimes brokers can be flaky. Our rums were brokered from E &amp; A Scheer BV to FineDrams, and recently arrived:

[Picture of XXX:Two and XXX:Three casks arrived at FineDrams](https://i0.wp.com/t8ke.review/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/casksarrivedatfinedrams.jpg?resize=1600%2C1200&amp;ssl=1)

where they will be bottled by Jonas. In keeping with the design of XXX:One, the labels for XXX:Two will look like:

[XXX:Two Label Front](https://i2.wp.com/t8ke.review/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/XXXTwoFront.png?w=827&amp;ssl=1)

[XXX:Two Label Back](https://i1.wp.com/t8ke.review/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/XXXTwoBack.png?w=759&amp;ssl=1)

[XXX:Three Label Front](https://i0.wp.com/t8ke.review/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/XXXThreeFront.png?w=829&amp;ssl=1)

[XXX:Three Label Back](https://i0.wp.com/t8ke.review/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/XXXThreeBack.png?w=760&amp;ssl=1)

with the colors being dictated by the major color of each country's flag. 

## Final Details

I asked FineDrams to go ahead and confirm the pricing for each of these. 

- XXX/TWO: 73 EUR (inclusive of VAT) / 65 USD (exclusive of VAT)
- XXX/THREE: 54 EUR (inclusive of VAT) / 48 USD (exclusive of VAT)
- DOK: 57 EUR (inclusive of VAT) / 51 USD (exclusive of VAT)

Wait a second. The fuck is DOK? Oh yeah, DOK. We should talk about DOK. 

## Protect Your Chikken from Dokken

Funk is in and funk is fun. In XXX:One, there wasn't a ton of funk. After trying a variety of super funk rums, we got to chatting. What if we could import our own DOK? Was it possible? Would anyone sell it to us? Most DOK, and similar, mark rum ends up in other products, like food or perfume, due to its aggressively pungent qualities. We wanted some. 

I wouldn't be writing this blurb if it weren't successful, so here we are. Yes, in addition to XXX:Two and XXX:Three, we have also been blessed with the opportunity to buy a vat of DOK mark rum distilled at Hampden estate and have it bottled at FineDrams. 

We said hell yeah, and it came a little while ago. It came, Jonas came, we all came. It comes in a huge plastic vat, because it is flammable and arrived at a whopping 86% ABV. The ABV and funk will both melt your face off. 

This isn't an official r/rum bottling, as it was conceived as a group effort of the Aficionados Discord server, where we talk about all things booze and also arrange single casks, but I knew it would be a perfect companion to the XXX Series bottlings. 

##DOK Details

The cool thing about also selecting a DOK was that we were given the opportunity to have chemical analysis conducted on it. Here are the details:

**General Analysis:**

|Type|Unit|Result|
:--|:--|--:|
|Alcoholic Strength|%Vol|85.76|
|Obscuration|%|&amp;lt;0.1|
|Density||0.8441|
|Turbidity|FTU|&amp;lt;0.1|
|Total|g/hlAA|2.8|
|Methanol|g/hlAA|1.7|
|Furfural|g/hlAA|10.5|
|pH||4.67|

**Volatile Substances:**

|Type|Unit|Result|
:--|:--|:--|
|VolatileAcids(as acetic)|g/hlAA|24.6|
|Aldehydes(as ethanal)|g/hlAA|188.1|
|Esters(as ethyl acetate)|g/hlAA|1488.8|
|Propan-1-o1|g/hlAA|1258.6|
|Butan-1-o1|g/hlAA|19.1|
|Butan-2-o1|g/hlAA|127.6|
|2-methylpropan-1-o1|g/hlAA|18.7|
|2&amp;amp;3-methylbutan-1-o1|g/hlAA|68.1|
|Total Volatile Substances|g/hlAA|3193.6|

So, this is a screaming rum. 1489 ester count is insane. We also got a chance to try some samples of two other marks, but DOK was the clear winner. 

Logistically, there are a couple of issues, though. 86% ABV is far too high to legally ship from one place, to just about any other place, via an airplane. So, DOK will be available via FineDrams in the US and abroad at 69% ABV, in order to comply with international shipping laws. I tried the 69% ABV DOK and it was still raw, powerful and intoxicating (literally). At this ABV, it was entirely improved. While it was fun to drink something at that 86% ABV, it was closed off, punishing and a chore. Down to the legal 69%, the spirit opened up incredibly, and released an array of flavors not found at nuclear ABV levels. 

Right now, the DOK is bottled at FineDrams and awaiting labeling. I can show you what the labels will look like, though. It's pretty sweet.

##Overall

So, in conclusions, there are a lot of really cool things happening in the r/rum community and for the internet rum scene. In sum, we have XXX:Two and XXX:Three currently being bottled, and DOK currently being labeled. I will post updates as we hit milestones each on XXX:Two, XXX:Three, and DOK.

ohiogator,cfd0g4,3,rum,Bourbon drinker looking to expand my tastes to rum,"Hello all! I am a long time bourbon fan that is getting tired of the price increases and difficulties in finding bottles that I love. I enjoy sipping drinks neat and I am looking for some recommendations and direction from people with more experience. 

I have searched this sub and found some really good recommendations for a few bottles to start with. My first purchase was a bottle of Mount Gay Black Barrel and I REALLY liked this one! It was very smooth and had the hints of vanilla and oak that I love about bourbon. For my next bottle, I decided to try and see if I liked ‚Äúfunky‚Äù Jamaican rum and bought a bottle of  Plantation Xaymaca. This rum is not for me. For me, it had a little too much banana (?), other fruit I cannot exactly place, and a medicinal (to my taste) finish. 

I would like to continue to try new bottles and I am looking at Appleton Estate 12 year and Pussers Rum. Would either of these be good jumping off points for me? 

Do you have any other recommendations with my limited experience in mind? I am looking to try various rums from different countries and expand my palate, but would hate to blindly buy things that I will definitely not enjoy given my tastes. 

TLDR: Moving on from bourbon, really liked Mount Gay Black Barrel; didn‚Äôt like Plantation Xaymaca at all. Please shoot me some recommendations of rums to try.",21,2019-07-20 04:53:21

I've been in the process of outfitting my collection for tiki, however I've been finding it difficult to find pot still lightly aged rums in Canada. I have pretty easy access to Wray and Nephew at LCBO, but I've been struggling in my research to find aged options. I'd love Smith &amp; Cross but good luck. Looking into stuff it really looks like there isn't anything available. On top of that those that MAY be pot still really have no information readily available on them.

I do have access to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario liquor options, but not much else.

So, does anyone know of a pot still lightly aged rum that might be available to me? Or perhaps, if you're familiar with the Smuggler's Cove book, you might know of something that fits within the pot still lightly aged category?

I recently bought a bottle of Tanqueray and some Schweppes tonic water. I have really enjoyed the combination at usually around a 1:3 and a 1:2 ratio with ice. What can I do to elevate this drink? Please keep in mind that I would like to keep both the tonic water and liquor prices within reasonable price levels.

I typically prefer my rum's on the rocks, so in saying that... this rhum was pleasantly surprising.

Admittedly, I know Captain is considered pretty ""basic,"" but I'm not a complicated guy. Well, today I thought I'd save a few bucks as i was buying at CVS instead of Wal-Mart or a liquor store and didn't want to pay 15 bucks for a fifth of Captain. Instead I paid 10 for a fifth of Bacardi Superior. The label said it's good for mixing due to a ""subtle"" taste, so I figured it'd be good to use for mixed drinks and I could save my remaining few shots of Captain for, well, shots.  So I decided to make a drink, 4 shots of rum and 4 shots of cola (diet pepsi cherry is my go-to) and OMG it's making me gag! The flavor is not subtle in the least. I'd equate it to mixing my cola with jet fuel!

ObeseMoreece,bzxyhn,5,rum,"Looking for a father's day rum, details of what he likes in the post.","He's in his 50s, lots of experience with whisky from working with a significant amount of distilleries in Scotland. He stopped accepting gifted bottles of whisky from client companies a while ago but has been getting in to rum. He's relatively new to it and started out trying the nicer ones out of the few bottles I've gotten.

In Scotland so rum selection generally isn't all that great here when out in bars. HE generally asks for Diplomatico as that's often the best of what is on offer.

The bottles he has in the house are as follows:

Killdevil's Single Cask Hampden 10 Year old 2007

Dark Sail Rhum Bologne

A Guadeloupe single cask rum distilled at Bellevue distillery in 1998, aged 18 years.

Two of those were aged in whisky casks and he seems to really like that.

He's also had some of my rums and seemed to enjoy Single Cane Estate's Worthy Park, Rumbullion and Diplomatico in particular. I will get him to try some of my Dictador 12 year as I feel he'd like that given that his tastes are similar to mine and Dictador 12 is by far my favourite. 

From his own experience with whisky, he generally doesn't bother with anything over 18 years old as the spirits tend to just take on the flavour of the barrel they're aged in after that (I agree and found that that happened with Zacapa 23).

My budget will be flexible but I'd say it'll be somewhere around ¬£60, maybe more. I'd love to hear what people in this sub would recommend given what he's had and likes so far.",11,2019-06-13 06:49:50

I'm coming from the bourbon world after getting tired of having to hunt and scrap for the best stuff. Tried some Rhum Clement VSOP at a friend's place and it made me want to check out more tasty runs.

First grab was Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, which was I thought was pretty good. Feels like drinking Cherry Cola more than a spirit though, so I wanted to go drier on the next pick. I was at the store and picking between Plantation 5 and Xaymaca, went with the latter and sadly regretting it. The funk is just too off putting for me currently, probably have to work my way back up to it. 

Any recommendations for a next bottle? Something more approachable than Xaymaca but drier than Diplomatico, preferably no added sugar. Wide range I know, but any help is appreciated!",8,2019-06-16 03:11:43

**BLANCO**

Palate; Crisp then Syrupy clean fresh pressed Suger Cane texture juice. Mild arrival but very pleasant. It's only flavour is a herbal hint.

**Finish:** Like clean biofuel that will get you engine going!

**Empty Bottle:** This charcoally smell. I can get through these Blanco's easy like Appleton 12 that was also 'natural' tasting. . 

Mixing: Ginger Beer (with real ginger) fantastic with that texture. I'm shitty on complex cocktails. 

**ANIVERSARIO**

**Smell and Palate:** Very Hot Wood. Big Acetone or Nail Polish. Those that  cut through this note that think it's 'banana' will find it more interesting.",3,2019-06-16 20:02:06

Also, in Oregon, the price point has dropped from $28 to $20 and I think that's fair based on the drop in age.

I first ""discovered"" FdC almost 15 years ago when I travelled to Nicaragua.  FdC 7 waseverywhere.  Now I think I'd choose Brugal over FdC based on Brugal being a better value.",3,2019-06-17 07:55:58

I'm basically wondering two things 1) if I got completely hosed on the prices and 2) if these actually are good sipping rums for me to start with?

Tarquin_Underspoon,c9vqvr,87,rum,Tarquin‚Äôs Unofficial r/Rum ‚ÄúWhat Should I Buy?‚Äù Guide,"I see a lot of, ‚Äúwhat rum should I buy?‚Äù posts on this sub, and pretty much all of the replies involve the same bunch of bottles. With that in mind, I thought I‚Äôd write up a quick guide of commonly available bottles that newcomers to rum might be interested in.

Please keep in mind that this is a list of, generally speaking, *readily available bottles.* If I included every single one-off or rare bottling, then this list would be both way longer and almost useless to the budding rum aficionado. Also, this selection centers around bottles available in the United States, so if you‚Äôre located in Europe or elsewhere, then your options may be different (and likely far better, you lucky so-and-sos!)

Also, on a final note: I know that some of my choices and omissions will be controversial, but please keep in mind that the following is my personal opinion only. I don‚Äôt (and, well, *can‚Äôt*) speak for the community at large.

So, here they are, in alphabetical order:

**Appleton 12-Year** - 43% - $35-$45. This Jamaican standby is a blend of pot and column distillate with an honest age statement and no added sugar. Its profile is very whisky-like with a hint of tropical fruit.

**Appleton Signature** - 40% - $18-$22. While not ideal for sipping like the 12-year, this Jamaican rum lends itself exceptionally well to cocktails.

**Bacardi 8-Year** - 40% - $22-$28. If all you have available to you is the Bacardis, then skip the rest of the range and head straight toward this eight-year-old Puerto Rican *ron*. It‚Äôs minimally sugared and makes a decent sipper or mixer.

**Barbancourt 8** - 43% - $22-$28. If the 15-year bottling is too spendy for your pocketbook, this younger bottling is also a tasty sipping rum.

**Barbancourt 15** - 43% - $35-$45. At fifteen years old, this Haitian sipping rum is a fantastic value. Expect a refined, cognac-like profile with some citrusy top-notes.

**The Clairins** - Various ABVs - $40-$45. If you‚Äôre really looking to dive headfirst into the wacky world of white rum, then grab one of these Haitian monsters. There are three currently available in the American market - Sajous, Vaval and Le Rocher - and they‚Äôre all worth owning.

**Clement 6/10/XO** - 40% ABV - $50-$70ish. The aged Clements offer a relatively gentle introduction to *rhum agricole*, or cane juice rum. All three expressions are worth grabbing if you‚Äôre in the market for a more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù bottle for your shelf.

**Damoiseau Pure Cane** - 55% ABV - $30-$35. The Gold Standard of white cane juice rums, at least in my book. Think fennel bulb, cane juice and citrus. It makes fantastic cocktails, and even sips well if your tastebuds are a little wacky like mine.

**Denizen Merchant‚Äôs Reserve** - 43% ABV - $28-$32. Originally formulated for Mai Tais, this unadulterated blend of Jamaica and Martinique distillate excels as a high-end cocktail ingredient.

**Doctor Bird** - 50% ABV - $25-$30. This aged, pure-pot-still Jamaican rum from Worthy Park was finished in moscatel wine casks. Expect sweet grapes alongside pungent funk and rotting tropical fruit (in a good way!)

**Don Q Oak Barrel Spiced Rum** - 45% ABV - $28-$32. Looking for a spiced rum that doesn‚Äôt taste like artificial cherries or vanilla extract? Then look no further than this honestly aged and infused spirit.

**Doorly‚Äôs 12** - 40% ABV - $25-$30. This cheap-ish aged Foursquare is a favorite daily sipper. Partially aged in ex-Madeira casks, it‚Äôs mildly sweet and fruity - the Glenlivet of rums. *Total Wine exclusive*

**Dos Maderas 5 + 5** - 40% ABV - $40-$45. If you‚Äôre a fiend for sherried Scotches, then this blend of Barbadian and Guyanan rum should be your first stop. The ‚Äò5 + 5‚Äô refers to the fact that this blend was aged five years in the tropics in ex-bourbon casks, then five more years in Spain in PX sherry casks.

**El Dorado 8** - 40% ABV - $22-$30. Despite its meager age statement, the 8-year El Dorado is a budget-friendly favorite, light on sugar and heavy on the molasses and star anise that we love about Guyanan rums.

**El Dorado 15** - 40% ABV - $50-$55. Looking for an upgrade from the tasty 8-year? Skip the too-sweet 12 and go straight for the oaky, pot-still-heavy 15. Expect a more well-aged, pungent Guyanan experience from this bottle.

**Foursquare 2004/2005/2007** - 59% ABV - $60-$75. Looking to grab a high-end, high-proof bottle? These periodic vintage releases from Barbados‚Äô Foursquare Distillery are our go-to recommendation. Expect oodles of vanilla bean, oak, citrus and coconut.

**Foursquare Spiced Rum** - 35% ABV - $13-$15. An honest spiced rum for very little money? Yes, please! If you‚Äôre not willing to splurge for the Don Q, then this should be your house spiced cane spirit. *Total Wine exclusive*

**Hamilton Demerara Rum** - 43% ABV - $22-$25. If all you‚Äôre looking for is an El Dorado variant without so much sweetness, and you don‚Äôt want to mess with the scorching 151-proof bottling, then this affordable bottling should satisfy that spot on your shelf.

**Hamilton Demerara 151** - 75.5% ABV - $28-$32. If you‚Äôre in the market for a floater for cocktails or fuel for 151 Swizzles, skip the Lemon Hart and look for this bottle from rum maestro Ed Hamilton and crew.

**Hamilton Navy Strength** - 57% ABV - $25-$30. A blend of aged rums from Guyana and Jamaica, this bottling from Rum Minister Ed Hamilton is great for sipping or sinking into high-octane cocktails. It‚Äôs full of caramelized banana, molasses and dark fruit.

**Mount Gay Black Barrel** - 43% ABV - $20-$25. If you‚Äôre craving the whiskey-like Barbadian profile on the cheap and don‚Äôt have a Total Wine nearby, then look for this budget-friendly bottle.

**Mount Gay XO** - 43% ABV - $40-$50. MGXO, as it‚Äôs affectionately known, is one of our basic recommendations for newcomers to rum from the whiskey world. It‚Äôs very whiskey-like in profile and additive-free, so it‚Äôs a relatively risk-free buy for bourbon and Scotch aficionados alike.

**Novo Fogo Barrel-Aged Cachaca** - 40% ABV - $38-$43. If you‚Äôre looking to see what cachaca - Brazilian cane juice rum - is all about, then splurge on this bottle. Novo Fogo age their spirit in re-charred ex-bourbon casks, so their aged cachaca caters very much to American tastes while still retaining its character.

**Pampero Aniversario Reserva Exclusiva - 40% ABV - $32-$40. If you‚Äôre looking for a significant step up from the likes of Bacardi and Cruzan but don‚Äôt want to travel too far away in terms of profile, then this lightly sugared Venezuelan *ron* may be to your tastes.

**Plantation Barbados 5-Year** - 40% ABV - $18-$25. This lightly sugared, cognac-finished riff on the typically unadulterated Barbadian style offers another budget-friendly alternative for fans of Mount Gay Black Barrel and Doorly‚Äôs.

**Plantation Jamaica Vintage** - Various ABVs - $45-$50. The best of the readily available Plantation vintage bottlings, in my humble opinion. This lightly sugared, cognac-finished Jamaican rum has been released in various vintages, from 2000 to 2005, and all of them are worth a purchase.

**Plantation OFTD** - 69% ABV - $28-$32. OFTD is a favorite around here for good reason. It‚Äôs a brilliant high-octane cocktail incredient, and with a little water it makes a fantastic sipper as well. Oh, and it comes in a hefty 1L bottle!

**Plantation Stiggins‚Äô Fancy** - 40% ABV - $25-$30. One of the few ‚Äúfruity rums‚Äù worth having on your shelf, The Stigs is dark rum infused with Victorian pineapples. It‚Äôs surprisingly balanced and not too sweet.

**Plantation Xaymaca** - 43% ABV - $23-$26. This new Jamaican blend from Plantation offers an affordable, approachable gateway into the realm of funky Jamaican hooch. It‚Äôs got the tropical fruit that you‚Äôd expect, but it won‚Äôt kick you in the face with funk.

**Pusser‚Äôs Gunpowder Proof** - 54.5% ABV - $35-$38. If you‚Äôre looking for a funky, molassesy Navy-style rum but can‚Äôt find the Hamilton, then Pusser‚Äôs has you covered. My advice: Skip the wimpy 42% ABV bottling and pay a little extra for this amped-up version.

**The Real McCoy 12** - 46% ABV - $50-$55. If you don‚Äôt have a Total Wine near you and can‚Äôt find the Exceptional Casks, then this third-party bottling is your best bet for that whisky-like Foursquare profile. Just make sure you‚Äôre getting the new 46% version and not the old 40% one.

**Rhum J.M. Blanc** - 50% ABV - $30-$33. If you can‚Äôt find the Damoiseau Pure Cane (or if that bottle isn‚Äôt to your tastes), then try on this unaged Martinique cane juice rum for size. It‚Äôs drier and more herbaceous than the Damoiseau, but it takes ‚ÄòTi Punches just as well.

**Rhum J.M. XO** - 45% ABV - $65-$70. The best readily available, high-end aged agricole, IMO. Expect loads of cognac/Armagnac-like notes alongside that signature J.M. herbal profile.

**Santa Teresa 1796** - 40% ABV - $38-$42. This Venezuelan blend of pot and column distillate is another good option for a higher-end, Latin-style sipping *ron*.

**Smith and Cross** - 57% ABV - $32-$38. If you *really* want to experience Jamaican funk, then this lightly aged, pure-pot-still Jamaican beast should be your next stop. It‚Äôs a titan of rotting fruit and funk that will put hair on your chest - if you can stand to take a sip.

**Stolen Overproof** - 61.5% ABV - $18-$22 (375mL). A more refined (but still kick-in-your-face punchy) alternative to Smith and Cross, this six-year-old sourced Jamaican bottling was supposed to be a limited release... but it can still be found everywhere.

**Velho Barreiro Cachaca** - 40% ABV - $16-$20. Looking for a budget-friendly cachaca to dump into Caipirinhas? This nondescript bottle is my go-to recommendation.

**Wray &amp; Nephew Overproof** - 63% ABV - $25-$28. Jamaican overproof rum is an essential bar staple, making everything from Wray &amp; Tings to Overproof &amp; Gingers to kickin‚Äô Daiquiris. Wray Overproof is the most widely available example of the style.",51,2019-07-07 00:52:22

Buckar007,bo7u22,5,rum,"Rum Content Question, What‚Äôs in the rum?","Greetings all,

I attended Chicago rumfest recently, and attended the talk hosted by Richard Seale from foursquare. Listening to him talk about his passion for rum, is enlightening to say the least. He is a big proponent of labeling, so that the consumer is aware of what they are buying. Where it‚Äôs from, what‚Äôs been added, etc...

He hinted at a website that discloses a great deal of the additives, good, and toxic. 

The question, where can one find these links to information? I‚Äôm quite curious about some of the toxic additives, and which rums carry them. 

I was also intrigued by the Guardians of Rum group he is forming, to help with identifying a rum‚Äôs origins, a Geographic Indication (GI), much like Champagne, or Scottish Whiskey. 

Many thanks in advance.",14,2019-05-14 03:17:06

spaok,bp6zgq,6,rum,"so much funk, so want more..","thanks to the reviewers here and on YouTube, plus several days of debating, I finally picked up a couple rums and I couldn't be happier about them.



First was the hard debate, I was eyeing Barbados like an old perv, mostly focusing on Mount Gay XO and Doorly's 12, with some glances at Plantation 20th, I really wanted something to sip on and maybe enjoy with a cigar on the warmer days. 


Since I'm not a big bourbon fan, I wanted to avoid sickly sweet stuff, so anything I considered I would check the hydro readings from [thefatrumpirate]( http://thefatrumpirate.com/hydrometer-tests-2) (awesome work btw) and see what people said about it.


In the end I decided to get an Appleton Estate 12yr, I wasn't really sure what ""funk"" was, but figured everyone gives it a good review and it seems to a good way to get a feel for the ""funk"".


I got home, cracked it, put a small pour into a old beef gelatin glass (don't ask) and took a sip. ""Very nice"" (Borat voice in my head), I dig it, it goes down very easy, definitely something I see myself enjoying.

I also kinda start seeing what the ""funk"" is. I realise it's similar to the esters ""funk"" of a real German Hefeweizen, the banananess that I really love about those. So it got me thinking, I wonder how my other rum I bought will be.

So I crack open the other rum and holy-ma-joly it's amazingballz, highpoof, esterery, amazingness, so glad I looked at [t8ke's review](https://old.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/7ejtka/review_529_stolen_overproof_jamaican_rum/) and bought it on a whim, I need more of it, more like it, more funky goodness.

What should I get next? Smith&amp;Cross?",19,2019-05-16 10:18:36

RustyAndEddies,bptjk7,5,rum,Just came back from NOLA with a few bottles of Roulaison Rum,"I found myself in NOLA last week with friends to visit a mutual acquaintance who moved out there years ago. I booked us a distillery tour at Roulaison Distillery. They are new to the scene and their facilities are quite small but they are certainly on the right track with their rum. Picked up a bottle of their barrel-aged and a small of their limited edition single barrel. The rum paired well with a cigar on a porch in the Bywater during a rambunctious thunderstorm this last weekend.

My friend grabbed a bottle of their Amer Herbal, a sort of herbaceous version of spiced, which was really a interesting choice considering many young distilleries tend to make cloying, spiced rum to cover bad batches. Also I was glad to see only their Amer was sweetened after the distillations.

If you are more interested in a more rum informative tour than trying good rum, you can always go to Celebration Distillations, which I did on my first visit 10 years ago.",11,2019-05-18 00:38:38

&amp;#x200B;

I got the foursquare 2005 and am enjoying it a lot. I picked this one because it is a nerd-bottling that is very transparent about its origin. I am under the impression Foursquare has plenty of these offerings. My question is, within the category of 'integrity rums' (age statement, high proof, no added sugar or color), what are other rums I should buy that are maximally different from the Foursquare, while still in the category of nerd rums? What are the guideposts in this space? 

Or, maybe, does this question not really make sense because in order to get the full idea of what rum is about one needs to leave the tight regulations of the integrity nerd category?

I've been drinking rum for just under a year now (any alcohol really, but it's rum 90% of the time), figuring out what I like and what I don't and I've sampled everything of note in my local stores so it's time to expand and order something online. I'm looking for something easy to drink neat or on the rocks and in the $25-50 range.

So far the easiest thing I've found was the Flor Dr Cana 18. I need to revisit the Flor 7, as I got it early on and was just mixing it.  I tried the Zacapa 23 and found it too sweet. On the flipside, Zafra 21 was a little too dry and Mt Gay was not to my palate for similar reasons. Zaya 12 is on the cheaper end of that range and has been a decent sipper for me, so have Bicardi 8 and 10 but I've gone back to the Zaya a few times (one bottle was notably sweeter than the others, almost as much as the Zacapa).

Smell: forgot to smell since there was a lid. My bad.

Taste: very sweet and herbal. Rock sugar, slightly over ripe bananas, vanilla, walnuts. A little grassy and floral. Comes together to remind me of Banana nut bread. Very refreshing, delicious, and pleasant. Not one dimensional at all.

From my little experience with rum, the herbal sugarcane sweetness, vanilla, and banana carry through to some rums, especially the less funky ones. Obviously this will vary by rum.

I‚Äôm planning a rum tasting event and am looking for some suggestions and tips from all of you fine folks out there!  I was thinking about organizing the experience into three separate flights and use each taste to inform on different aspects of rum.  The audience will be largely rum novices or have some basic understanding rum.  The tasting will consist of small pours (thinking ¬Ω oz) and will be done over 2+ hours.

The rums I listed below are just ideas for now with some possible discussion topics below them.  Some of the rums I listed are for convenience (like I was gifted a giant bottle of Naked Turtle and would welcome the excuse to use some up).  But please suggest others that will work or that will have some fun and interesting talking points to bring up.

-
**Flight 1:**  Unaged and Unblended
The thought here was to have three rums that will help the drinker understand the variance in production and distillation. I know they are very generalized and not all that helpful‚Ä¶ but my thought was have a representative from each of the colonial styles, English, French, and Spanish.

1.	Rum Fire.

   2. Possible Discussion Points:  Pot stills, dunder, funk, molasses

2.	Trios Rivieres.

   2. cane juice, vegetal, AOC

3.	Naked Turtle.

   2. Column still, molasses

**Flight 2:**  Exploring blends and blenders as well as addatives.

1.	El Dorado 15.

   2.	Blending different distillates, Wooden stills, sugar and coloring.

2.	Plantation 3 star

   2.	Blenders, cocktails, filtration

3.	Suggestion for a third? Maybe something overproof or Merchant‚Äôs Reserve 8?

**Flight 3:**  longer

1.	VSOP Agricole (thinking JM VSOP)
2.	Plantation Jamaican Vintage?
3.	Older column still rum (thinking Flor de Cana or Don Pancho 18?)",16,2019-05-31 08:48:48

LongCity,bvoy6d,2,rum,The Beginning of a Potential Rum Journey,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I spend most of my time over on the Scotch and Whiskey side of things and in a recent thread I created, a lot of people were recommending rum/rhum as a good summer/warm day drink and so, I decided to look into what one of the shops I frequent for Scotch has as far as rum/rhum goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy all types of Scotch, from High to Lowlands, Islands to Islays to Campbeltown; sherry to bourbon finished; smoke, peat, spicy, fruity, etc. There is a time, place, and mood for everything. As for Bourbons, I enjoy the wheated variety more. For both types of spirits, I lean towards the higher proof offerings - preferably 46% ABV and up. 43% if I have to, and pretty much skip 40% altogether (snobby, I know).

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, I have compiled a list of 11 expressions, along with pricing, to hopefully be guided in the right direction. Suggestions and input from this list would be most helpful, but other recommendations are welcomed. I have done a bit of research and see that Foursquare rums come up a lot, however, I couldn't find it in the shops in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to note, these are likely the cheapest prices around me (I'm in Alberta, Canada) barring sales and are in CAD.

  
Zacapa 23 **$68.00**

El Dorado 8 Year Old Rum **$35.00**  
El Dorado 12 Year Old Rum **$33.00**

El Dorado 15 Year Old Rum **$49.00**  
Flor De Cana Centario 12 Year Old **$39.00**

Flor De Cana Centenario Gold 18 Year Old **$58.00**

Plantation XO 20th Anniversary **$58.00**

Barbancourt Rum 8 Year Old **$35.00**

Barbancourt 15 Year Old **$51.00**

Appleton Estate 12 Year Old **$40.00**

not_what_that_means_,by4w3v,10,rum,Calories in rum,"Hey all! This is a question I've been thinking about for a few weeks now, and especially over the last few days when there was a post here about new labeling rules (https://redd.it/bwu3bp). I've been calorie counting over the last few months in an attempt to finally get down to a healthy weight, and something that has helped me a lot is being able to sip a nice rum or whiskey in the evening - it's rich, very flavorful, you can stretch out a session for 30-60 minutes, and it's only about 100 calories for a serving. 

To count calories in spirits, I've been using a table that was posted to /r/Scotch a while back (https://redd.it/40mgu3).

This is where things get a little interesting (or, at least, as interesting as they can possibly be for a discussion of the nutritional value of an alcoholic beverage that people definitely don't drink for their health). I have a bottle of Real McCoy limited edition lying around, which happens to have nutrition facts on the back. The bottle itself recommends a serving size of 50mL, which it says contains 97 calories. HOWEVER - this has an ABV of 46% - the chart says that 45 mL of 46% ABV Spirit has 115 calories (cba to extend that up to 50 mL. Point is, it's more than 97). 

I confirmed this with a little bit of math - 50 mL of 46% spirit is 23 mL of pure ethanol. Ethanol has 7 calories per gram, and a density of .789 g/mL (riveting stuff, I know). This means that a 50 mL serving of this rum would have 7 * (23 * 0.789) calories, which evaluates to a little over 120. 

Obviously, there's no way to no for sure without conducting actual experiments, which would just be a tremendous waste of delicious rum. And it doesn't even really matter - we're looking at a difference of about 25 calories, or 0.7% of the calories you would need to eat to gain a pound. I just think it's interesting in light of the earlier post - even if we start to see actual published nutrition facts, I might still be more inclined to trust the table/math, especially if the calorie count put out by the distillery is a more favorable number. 

This doesn't mean that I'm against this - quite the opposite, in fact. More oversight over this is great, especially in something like rum that can be very diverse. It'll be interesting to get a number on the sugar added to El Dorado and Zacapa (I know that there's information on that somewhere), and to see how that affects the overall calories. Just something to consider.",3,2019-06-08 14:02:24

groutrop,by7yzl,9,rum,What rum should I buy next?,"Have been enjoying rum for about a year now, mostly with the help of this sub. Started off rums with the Kirk and Sweeney 12 years old, enjoyed it and then came to know about dosing and all that stuff and wanted to try more authentic rums. So next I got the Santa Teresa 1796 and Brugal 1888 which I feel were both excellent quality rums with a smooth delicious flavour. Now that I'd got a taste of some proper rums I wanted to try a different flavor so I got lucky enough to get the Appleton estate 12 year old which was surprising at first and then loved later. 

So now I'd like to go further and try something even more interesting in terms of flavour. I think I can get a single bottle through a friend abroad so I'm thinking which one to get. I think I would enjoy the funky element and am open to trying something truly hard hitting now. 

Choices Im looking at are the Hamilton St Lucia bottles 9 year old ones which seem very well regarded and with a flavour to look forward to. Or something lesser priced like the Smith and Cross or Pussers Gun Powderproof or the 15 year old. Another choice I'm thinking of is the Barbancourt 15 year old. If you guys have suggestions on what I should try next would love to hear it. And suggestions for good rums I have overlooked are welcome. I'd like a flavour profile thats different from what I've tried till now. I think I can get only a single bottle so thats a limitation.

A few that I found pretty solid:

Naked Turtle
Siesta Key
Roulaison pot still

I typically prefer to drink rum neat or on the rocks and am not a huge fan of vodka.

So do you guys mix your white rum or drink it straight or what? Some of these rums get pricey like $30-40 for 750 so it would be hard for me to want to use that as a mixer",21,2019-04-16 03:11:28

Mournelithe,bdtarr,11,rum,Paris Rhumfest 2019 - a roundup,"So this was the fourth one I‚Äôve been to from the last five years, and the best one yet.  The move into the larger exhibition space and most importantly away from the glass ceilings made it ever so much more pleasant to move around.  

Around 140 brands from 50 countries made it an incredibly diverse selection, and it was good to see the little brands getting just as much attention from the crowds as the big players.   

Among the standouts for me were two Asian stalls - Sampan from Vietnam and Helios from Japan.   Sampan is a very recent startup from a couple of French guys living in Vietnam, they imported some ex-Armagnac column stills and are making long ferment sophisticated white agricole style rum.  It comes in three varieties, a 48, 54 and an overproof, the 54 was just perfect, well balanced and full of flavour.   
Helios by contrast is a much older distillery from Okinawa.  Mostly working with molasses, they do a really interesting white from a 30 day open ferment, twice through their pot stills, blended with product from a batch process hybrid still for volume.   Branded as Kiyomi, it was really tasty.  On the counter they had a five year old Teeda, which was honestly just weird.  A blend of barrels, most of it is aged in barrels previously used for a local spirit called awamori, which give a completely different flavour to the rum.  Can‚Äôt say I was a fan, but glad I tried it.  Under the counter however they had a 21yr old Teeda aged exclusively in ex-bourbon that was just divine.  Apparently they have 10, 12 and 15 year expressions available in Japan so this is a company I want to see more of.  

On the French front, Trois Rivieres has released a new range aimed squarely at bartenders.  First up was 55 Origin, a slow reduction white which was very clean and tasty with just a hint of the alcohol.  Next was Double Wood, 43%, a young 12m eleve sous bois aged an extra 6m in new American oak.  Soft and delicate, it stands up well against the younger styles.  
Third was Vieux de la Ocean, a 3yr old which is reduced by distilled seawater from the Diamant area instead of the usual spring source.  How distillation preserves the salinity is an exercise for the reader.  Bottled at 54% I found it hot and spicy, with a hint of salinity.  
The last though was the most interesting - Cannes Brulee.  Cane sourced from a heavily burned cane field, released at 43%, this is heavily smoky caramel, very like a mescal.   This is their second batch, they made one as an experiment at the end of last year and immediately repeated it in volume at the start of this season.  

La Favorite has released a pair of white monovarietals, one Canne Rouge ‚ÄúRivi√®re Belair‚Äù, one Canne Roseau ‚ÄúLa Digue‚Äù.  Both are late harvest with a 1 week open ferment.  The La Digue at 52% is fresh and clean with a late heat.  Nice enough.  Riviere Belair on the other hand is absolutely delicious.  53%, hotter up front but softer overall. A lovely fresh flavour with a sweetness running through it and a very nice lingering taste.  This is one I want to give to my friends who don‚Äôt drink agricole.   

I want to give a shoutout to the guys from Cape Verde, who have a tiny production of some 100l per day but make some solid rum, great to see some unknown producers getting publicity.  

It was also good to see a solid quartet of Madeira‚Äôs producers there, Engenhos de Calheta, Engenho de Norte, William Hinton and O Rezinho all had good offerings.   

On the usual suspects front, Foursquare had 2007, which is a worthy successor to 04 and 05, Empery, which is sherry, sherry and just a hint of sherry, a clear follow up to Premise, and the Doorlys 14 which is solid, but almost getting too old, the woody notes start to dominate the aftertaste.",7,2019-04-16 20:23:21
TangyDuck,bdziy7,0,rum,Rum was invented in part by the Irish.......A hot take,"Right so, This is something that has been floating around in my head for a while but I can't get much proof and can't remember how it got there, where I read it or what not. but here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

My argument is that the Irish invented rum due to the fact that they were indentured servants in British Caribbean colonies. While working with the slaves during the sugar refining process they noticed that the locals were drinking the slightly fermented molasses. As they were Irish and knew about distillation they thus distilled this mixture in part inventing what today is known as Rum......I know this is a long shot but sure look the Irish went everywhere.",2,2019-04-17 05:33:42

Now I also have Habitation Velier  Worthy Park which is completely different to the above mentioned. Obviously higher ABV, more citrus flavour (less sweet), less caramel and more burn. But with a dash of water it seems to have a lot more going on than the sweet caramel described above,

Ninjakillzu,bf89ey,6,rum,I made my first rum cocktail!,"After getting all the necessary ingredients, I made a 1944 mai tai. For the rums, I used Plantation Xaymaca and Clement VSOP Vieux Agricole (the VSOP, and aged agricole in general, was not easy to find). As the the orange liqueur, the only one available at the time was Grand Marnier. The orgeat I used was Liber &amp; Co orgeat syrup (it was also hard to find a good, natural orgeat made from quality ingredients.). I followed the traditional recipe, and it was really delicious! This was also my first mai tai. Of course, since I am in WA, I had to pay through the nose because of the state liquor tax. Clement VSOP was around $55 before tax, and around $70 after tax!
I'm definitely going to make more of these in the future.",4,2019-04-20 12:03:48

""After years of being lost in a sea of Coke and other mixers, rum is  finally emerging as a sipping spirit. Is this a good thing or a bad  thing? And can rum actually attract whiskey drinkers and collectors?

On  this episode of the award-winning podcast Life Behind Bars, co-hosts  David Wondrich and Noah Rothbaum discuss these developments, including  the rise of collectible pot still rums and the associated snobbery, as  well as the recent fiery debates on social media between rum  aficionados.""",62,2019-05-08 04:10:49

thewhiskeyshelf,bn7ago,8,rum,"@Razzafranchen, I was not ready for Hamilton 7 year cask strength (my bottle is probably from the next year, clocking in at 63.8%)","Full disclosure, I bought this bottle because @Razzafranchen rated it so highly and I can still buy it around where I live. 

This is not a review, but more a reflection on how unprepared I was for the insane funk (if you didn't notice, Foursquare 2011 is in the photo, and I really like it). 

Holy mother of Thor Hamilton 7 year CS is incredibly funky. As primarily a bourbon drinker (for suckers I know), I'm not accustomed to this smell. It's this really wild mix of freshly burnt rubber, durian fruit, overripe bananas (to the point that they're completely black) that you then left out for another week, freshly pressed sugar cane, vanilla, and something just insanely herbal. It reminds me of very sweet Chinese medicine. It's so ripe, off, and wild. I wasn't ready for that.

The flavors are honestly very similar, and I was completely unprepared for it. I'm not saying that I don't like it because I kind of do, I'm saying that it's probably the craziest thing I've drank in a long time. No bourbon, rye, scotch, tequila, other rum, or Baijiu comes even close. 

This is not a review, and there is no rating. All I can say is...holy...it's funky...and I wasn't ready for it...but I kind of like it.",10,2019-05-11 10:57:12

I'm looking to pickup something ideally lower end of the sugar scale, for sipping on.

Would any suggestions, some of the ones I've been eye'n are:

* Plantation 20th
* El Dorado 12 Guyana
* Doorlys 12
* Mount Gay XO

what you think would be good to grab? I seen some add coloring or chill filtering, I assume like Scotch it's better to avoid that if you want less smooth more interesting?

![img](2dcfrgmlkcn21)

*Sadly, I had to say goodbye to this bottle today and figured what better way to immortalize it than with a proper review. Originally opened it in June of 2017‚Ä¶ so I think it may have mellowed out a touch.* 

**Quick stats**: This is a 10 year old pot and column blend rum from the Foursquare Exceptional Cask Series (Mark V to be exact). It was aged in ex-bourbon and ex-madeira casks. Not sure about what the blend was on each. Color is a light amber hue. It is bottled at 56% ABV. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Nose**

My mind immediately conjured up the image of a good bourbon underneath a layer of that whipped marshmallow cream spread. It‚Äôs a wonderful balance of spice, sweet, and ripened tropical fruit. The faintest smell of oak if you really search for it. I don‚Äôt know my spices well enough to classify it, but it‚Äôs got a very pleasant sweet/earthy spice note. Its not cinnamon or nutmeg or clove‚Ä¶ Maybe it‚Äôs allspice? Holding it farther from my nose I can get more sugary and tropical fruit. I want to keep looking for more‚Ä¶ After a sip, the sugary notes are more noticeable. But not overly sweet. Talking about the smells of brown sugar or steens cane syrup, dark corn syrup. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Taste**

Easy, wonderful, tropical, welcoming. The sweet and spice balance that I can pick up on the nose is alive and well on the tongue now. Off the bat I would think this is a finished rum that clocked in at a  40-45% ABV rum. I detect something smoothing out the rum on the back and I think that‚Äôs the Madeira cask finish. Bourbon spice notes come in after the path has been paved. Very complex in that you can get a lot from it, yet very approachable and simple in that you can detect what‚Äôs going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Finish**

Everything from the taste rises a slow decrescendo out. After the initial taste, I can sense a rise in alcohol. There is the 56% ABV. It's a somewhat oily mouthfeel, banana and pineapple come to mind after the spice settles a bit. Pleasant is all I can say to describe it. There is nothing up to this point that has been off putting.  

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts: This would be absolutely delightful with a large piece of ice and one lime zest (no juice). I don‚Äôt know much, but to me this is a fantastic drinking experience, and it just so happens to be a rum. ",9,2019-03-21 06:08:42

- what's the stagg jr equivalent (high proof, not too expensive, highly regarded)?
- what's the overhyped thing that's good, but not for what it costs / availability (eg, Pappy)?
- best hidden secrets in rum that most people don't know about now but will become annoying popular in a few years

So far I have been only to Cuba and Dominican Republic, and my shopping experience was that, as local consumption is negligible, Cuba does not offer more/better locally than in Europe, e.g. HC Reserva Maestros is 40-50$ both there and in Europe.
In the meantime in Santo Domingo I have seen plenty of great and rare rums costing few times less (Brugal Leyenda for 16$ instead of 90$, Quorhum Unhiq for AFAIR 40$ instead of 100$ etc).

GeneralChipperson,b8r4i2,1,rum,Question about a dominican run that I had.,"Afew years ago, a friend went on a trip to the Dominican Republic and brought me back the best bottle of rum I have ever had. 

Was wondering if anyone on this sub might be able to help me identify it. It was a large clear bottle, with a golden sun on the front and a cork instead of a screw on cap. The rum itself was a light Carmel color and had a strong hint of vanilla.

If anyone can help its greatly appreciated.",0,2019-04-03 08:22:43
EasternAdventures,b8s7b6,3,rum,Noob question on Rum as you progress through a bottle,"This might have been asked before, but I couldn‚Äôt really find anything. If it has been asked and you all prefer I read that, please direct me to the post.

I‚Äôve posted in here once before, but just as a prerequisite: I‚Äôm a Rum noob, but really enjoying getting into it. So I just recently finished El Dorado 12 and El Dorado 15 and noticed something as I got near the bottom of the bottle. The taste definitely changed. A week or so ago when I started El Dorado 15 I got what I would explain as a dried fruit flavor with some heat. Now today as I finished my last few ounces, I definitely feel as some of the sweetness/fruitiness has gone away and left with a more honey flavor, especially in the finish. I had the same type of experience with El Dorado 12.

I only had each bottle about 1.5 weeks from opening to finishing it. So my question is: do you notice a change in characteristics (nose, flavor, finish, etc.) as you progress from a full  bottle to an empty one? Does the quality of a Run impact that? I felt I enjoyed them more in the beginning and was left a bit wanting near the bottom of the bottle.",4,2019-04-03 10:09:05

I‚Äôve given them a list of rums that I can‚Äôt get in the North Carolina ABC system. I know if they get rum in St Thomas they will be able to bring more home. I‚Äôve read recently that the duty-free prices in the USVI aren‚Äôt as good as one would expect. Is this true?

I‚Äôve heard K-Mart and Pueblo‚Äôs have some of the best prices near the cruise ship port. True? Do they have more than just Cruzan and Bacardi there?

This bottle was purchased on my parent's honeymoon sometime in the late 1980's. It was only opened summer of 2018. It has small flecks of some unknown substance in it. I have honestly no idea what they are. My guess is some kind of congealed sugars maybe or even some kind of bacteria. Either way I just let them settle to the bottom and carefully pour or sip from the top. When the bottle gets low I probably will strain it just to be safe.   
It smells amazing and tastes even better. Very very smooth despite the massive proof. Has a tendency to evaporate in the mouth and on the way down, very interesting sensation.",6,2019-02-16 11:49:38

WVL11,asw4zt,73,rum,An index of every American rum (w/ production details),"**tl;dr:** I‚Äôve been working on making an index of all American rums with details on things like base ingredients, age, distillation method, additives, etc. because labels and distillery websites (much to my chagrin) don‚Äôt always provide that kind of info. And I like to know how what I'm drinking is made, damn it! After spending time on this sub, thought some of y‚Äôall might be able to make use of it too. You can check it out here: [americanrumreport.com/distillery-index](http://americanrumreport.com/distillery-index)

&amp;#x200B;

**A little more backstory:** Basically, I've become very interested in American rum over the past couple of years and had the itch to start learning more about it. When I was sampling a bottle from a South Carolina distillery and couldn't find any details on it other than that it was ""handcrafted,"" I thought a resource like this would come in handy.

&amp;#x200B;

**A few surprises I've had while working on this:**

* There are well over 230 U.S. distilleries making rum now, and that number is going up fast. I'm finding ones I need to add to the index almost daily. (Please let me know if you see some missing! I already have a list of 15 or so I know need to be added.)
* There are at least 6 distilleries making real deal agricole-style rums with fresh, locally-sourced and crushed cane juice (or fresh cane syrup, in one case). I was aware of St. George (California), Richland (Georgia), and Manulele (Hawaii) prior to starting the research for this, but not of the others.
* There are also several distillers using double-retort pot stills. I spoke to one yesterday and when I asked him why they decided to go that route he replied, ""Because we don't do things the smart way."" :) 
* Most distilleries I've communicated with have been refreshingly transparent about their process and ingredients. Not all, but most. This is encouraging!

Anyway, check it out if you're interested and I'd love any feedback of how I could improve it. Over time, I plan to make the information about every distillery's products more robust. Some have more information than others right now, but I tried to at least find out base ingredients, distillation method, and aging details for every listing.",67,2019-02-21 08:24:37

Do any of you fellow rum enthusiasts have a source for the actual production requirements in the DR? While the rum he was pouring me was delicious, it certainly lacked the ""holy shit, that's too much wood"" that a 15+ year old Bourbon would have. ",8,2019-02-21 23:33:08

After some research with other posts and reviews, also people looking to replace tattoo.
I have bought these four.

Chambord ~ brings a berry flavor like tattoo 
Jeagermiester ~ has some similar herbs and spices
cpt morgans black ~ is vanilla based like tattoo
Kraken~ also like  the black its a suitable vanilla
Hoping to make a base with the kraken and or black, then use jeager and chambord to tune it.

2 years ago I went to Vinales in Cuba and I bought a special rhum from a factory/tourist trap. That Rhum was the Guayabita del Pinar dulce, producted by La Occidental.  
Me and my wife loved it, and we almost finished the whole bottle in less than two weeks. We have left one fifth of a bottle, there for a special occasion, and since then we tried to find someone that would have brought one from there. Finally, this Christmas one of her friends went to Vinales on vacation, and she discovered that the factory closed :( :( :( We don't know if it was just a liquor store or if they really produced there the rhum, so we don't know if they really stopped producing it. But it's sure as hell that we will not have more Guayabita from that source.  
So, I went searching in all of the internet some info about that rhum, but without any luck.  
Does anybody knows it and knows where to find the Guayabita del Pinar (the dulce one, not the seca) and/or knows similar rhums?

So I think rum is my favorite alcohol out of all the ones I've tried so far. What is the best way to drink it?",12,2019-01-10 00:38:59

My wife and I are about to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary.  We had our honeymoon at Cane Garden Bay in the BVI.  While there, we bought a bottle of Arundel Rum from Callwood Distillery.  

I am trying to get a bottle of their 10 year old rum for our anniversary in a month. The US importer will ship to a business address in the following states: Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Washington DC.  Also, it has to be shipped to a business address (no home offices).  

Unfortunately, I don't live in those, or know anyone with a business address in those states.  

Can anyone help out?

Having read some about rum Agricole, I was intrigued so I bought some Clement Premiere Canne Rhum Blanc.

I thought that was pretty interesting! Grassy and a little funky, and having read some about the Haitin Clairins I figured that would be a pretty interesting rum to try. I chose this because it seemed like people loved it and it had a reputation as being incredibly unique. I just got it in the mail yesterday from old town tequila and it tastes pretty terrible. It tastes like if someone vomitted on a burning tire. There is one pervading taste and smell that makes this an extremely non-nuanced spirit, and I can't get any of the grassy and bright flavors that I got with the Clement Rum Agricole...

ExtremelyDubious,9z5auc,1,rum,Where to start with rhum agricole.,"So I've been into rum for a while and have tried quite a few; I certainly wouldn't call myself an expert at this point but neither am I an ignoramus. But so far I've only been drinking molasses-based rums and I'm increasingly curious to try some rhum agricole as well. Trouble is I'm not sure where to start. I've read very good things about Rhum Barbancourt 5-Star, so that's a contender, but I've also read claims that it itsn't that typical of Rhum agricole in general.

So I thought I'd throw it out to the floor. What rhum agricole should I try first? I'm ideally looking for something that fulfils the following criteria:

* A good standard. I'd like to start with something that is fairly typical of agricoles, that will serve as a decent stand-in for the style in general.
* A decent sipper. I'm not averse to mixing rum, but I'd like to start with something I can enjoy by itself so that I can get a more complete appreciation of the flavour.
* Ideally under ¬£40, although I might be able to stretch to slightly more. There are several great rums in the ¬£30-40 price bracket so I don't think this is too unrealistic. I have been known to spend more than ¬£50 on rum but only on rums that I was confident that a) were pretty special and b) I was definitely going to like. Right now, with Christmas approaching, this is as much as I can afford.
* Available in the UK.

Any suggestions?",11,2018-11-22 01:31:27

ScrumpleRipskin,a28j20,1,rum,"Rum and added sugar -- which rums, that are any good, have the least added sugar?","I love perusing well-stocked liquor stores and picking up a bottle of something new once or twice a month. My favorite being damn near any form of whiskey -- bourbon, scotch, Japanese, rye, 12, 15, 17 yr etc. I haven't really met one I hate, just ones I like less than others.

I've brought home a rum every now and again from $25-$75 but can't get over how sweet they all taste. The last couple I got were Zaya and Zacapa. Both weren't bad but so very sweet. I was thinking about getting another tomorrow and did a quick Google search to find a low-sugar one. This site shows that most rum on the shelf has an added 10-45 grams of sugar per liter:  http://www.drecon.dk/index.php/17-list-of-rum-measured

First of all, does this seem accurate? It's really disappointing to me, that a good liquor can't be made without masking its flavors with a ton of sweetness before bottling.

After filtering out the high-sugar brands, I was left with the following list and I was wondering what your take on which I should try and hunt that are popular enough that I'm likely to see it on the shelf in the US and if it's worth even buying. I think I've seen Clement and Appleton Estate and maybe Doorly's locally. Are they any good? I prefer sipping neat or on the rocks.

I'm European, so getting hold of Cuban rums isn't difficult, but what are the ones I should look for that aren't easily purchased from the supermarket here in London or that are much cheaper in Cuba.

I'm generally open to all rums, but I'm not convinced about buying anything over the ¬£50 or $60 mark. What gems have you found and what shops could you recommend in Havana or Varadero. ",7,2018-12-08 17:39:41

Can you recommend something similar? As a whisky nerd I prefer stuff without anything artificial- I don‚Äôt want sugar or colorant added if possible. Any regulations in rum or how to tell?

Hartvigson,a50y4n,1,rum,Black Tot...,"I tried the Black Tot at a Rum &amp; Whisky festival in late October. I really liked it but it is ""a bit"" outside my budget. I do own an old bottle of Pusser's blue label at 54% but sadly this is not very similar in taste at all. The Black Tot had a smoky licorice tone to the taste that is lacking from my Pussers. It was a very bold, full flavoured rum that I could really get into. My old bottle of Sea Wynde was actually closer than Pusser's in taste. My wife threatened me with having to sleep in the garage if I ever bought one after she found out how expensive it is. So the next logical step is to try to find a substitute... Does anybody here know of a rum that is similar to the Black Tot in taste and character? Preferably at a lower price.

For some reason I haven't been enjoying this neat or on the rocks too much. I find it's almost a bit too flavorful. I've tried mixing it in some rum cocktails but I've been finding I have to limit myself to 1oz or less per drink or it's a bit too powerful of a taste. 

I will say I've never had a better rum sour before. Tried a mix with around 2/5 of a lemon, agave syrup, a little bit of maple syrup, and 1.5oz of it and it's delicious. My brother brought back some high quality Colombian honey from his trip the other day which I'm excited to do an experiment with.

And rum/coke with this (has to be only 1oz, with a fair bit of coke) is delicious too, although I feel like it's a sin to drink this this way.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that it's bad, I do like it, just not what I was expecting entirely. My favorite rum so far is Diplomatico reserva (the orange label, I haven't tried exclusiva yet)

grndzro4645,9w0zvk,1,rum,Colonial/Navy style rum with a splash of Laphroig 10y. OMFG amazing.(crosspost with /whiskey),"Ok so I have a bottle of the local rum which is a really good colonial/navy rum made via double pot distilled, blackstrap molasses, aged in quarter casks for 4 years. Kinda reminiscent of Potters without the citrus, and floral notes. All meaty molasses, and just a touch of sweetness.

Add a splash of Laphroaig 10 and it is simply incredible. You get all the rum flavor, yet can also taste all the scotch coming through at every point. It's a really good mix.

**More tasting notes:** You take a sip and initially it's rum but there is something in it that makes you sit back and examine the flavor more closely. That's when the scotch hits you and the full mouth of Laphroaig comes through. They both blend together on the backend with an earthy, smokey, molasses taste. ",0,2018-11-11 12:23:49
thelonecaner,9w2bba,1,rum,Velier's 2018 National Rums of Jamaica Series,"These are four rums from the Long Pond estate in Jamaica, released by Velier over the last few months (we've been seeing photos on FB for quite some time now). I was fortunate enough to try them all together, and sampled them in sequence of lowest esters --&gt; highest, with some interesting results.

Short version (with direct links to longer reviews for those who want more details and the background to the terminology):

[Vale Royale ""VWR"" 2006 12YO](http://thelonecaner.com/r0563/): Very traditional Jamaican profile, lowest esters of the quartet, 62.5%. Fruity, funky, earthy nose, strong palate redolent of flowers, fruits and yeasty bread. 87 Points

[Cambridge ""STCE"" 2005 13YO](http://thelonecaner.com/r0564/): Different, powerful and tasty, all at once. Jute rice bags, a tanning works and a bag of fruits on the palate. Very original, starting to edge away from the mainstream. 84 points

[Long Pond ""TECA"" 2003 15 YO](http://thelonecaner.com/r0565/): Utterly off the scale. This has the most intense hogo I've ever tried, literally a haunch of rotting meat in your living room...which then does a vanishing act on the palate which is bitter, crisp, sour and fruity all at once. 79 points

[Long Pond ""TECC"" 2007 11 YO](http://thelonecaner.com/r0566/): Even though this has the highest ester count of the set (1500 g/hlpa), it tones down the worst and emphasizes the best of all the others, and maintains originality while still being solidly Jamaican. 86 points.

Notes: Tread carefully.  The Vale Royal is the most approachable and the TECA is...well, it's different. Luca Gargano issued these as partly a series for the Jamaica lovers out there, partly to show off how esters intersect with tropical ageing to provide something new, and partly just because he had these aged Long Ponds kicking around and wanted to share, and when was the last time we ever got to try those, right?

Reetgeist,9wj4at,1,rum,Suggest my next rum,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the UK and looking for something \~¬£50 or less.  I'm mostly a beer, whisky and vodka drinker, but after a 10 year plus period of just drinking spiced rum mojitos, a specific summer cocktail demanded a demerara rum which in turn got me into drinking sippable stuff.  

&amp;#x200B;

The story so far:-

\- Woods Navy.  Bottle.  Classic (for me) but better mixed.  Always going to have this is in for tiki stuff.  

\- El Dorado 12.  Bottle.  Loved it to bits.  

\- Havana Club White.  Bottle.  Nah.  

\- Appletons Reserve Blend.  Bottle (some left).  Nice, not my favorite. 

\- Diplomatico Extra Riserva.  Bottle (some left).  Liked it but a touch on the sweet side even for me.

\- Goslings Black Seal.  Pub Pour.  Not a big fan.

\- Bacardi Gold.  Pub Pour.  Didnt like, which I was surprised by since when I was \~21 this tasted amazing.  

\- Havana Club 7.  Casino Pour. Meh.  Starting to think pure column still rums aren't for me.  

\- Wray &amp; Nephew overproof.  Bottle (lots left).  Sipping this was a mistake, but the bottle is definitely growing on me.  

\- Doorlys 12 year old.  Someone else's bottle.  Nice but I wish it were stronger.  

\- El Dorado 15 year old.  Pub Pour.  This was absolutely delicious in a rum bar but not sure if I'm committing to a bottle right now (its ¬£60 in my local rum shop, I bought it for a friend's birthday.  Cheaper on Amazon.)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it's payday and I have money left.   Not sure where to go.  I'm not precious about dosage, but equally Im not excluding undosed stuff.  I'm probably at this point excluding cuban style rums, but that leaves a lot of potential choices.   
 What do?

I've been looking for a rum to gift to someone, and I came across isla del tesoro. I liked the history it has and the presentation is amazing. However, I cannot find any information on the product itself. Several online shops list it, but nearly no information on them, let alone a proper review.
I appreciate that there are two versions, the ""real deal"" and the more recent open to the public one, but I cannot find information on either. I did find one small review in a blog post but I believe that one was for the real deal.

Anyway, the reason for this post was to see if anyone around here has any information on the actual quality of the rum? Because I also have my eye on a ""Santiago de Cuba 20 Year Old Rum"" and the price difference is 4 times over on the isla del tesoro!!!

I'm really confused because I can only find just 'Coruba' in Australia and all the listings for it keep on talking about how it's a very dark molasses-y rum.

More questions! Appleton Estate Signature costs about the same as the linked Coruba. Would either work in a Zombie for the Dark Jamaican Rum component? What would be better? Coruba seems... darker. Is that just the food colouring / colour of the bottle?

My usual drink is Scotch, and in Scotch, there is a tendency among the more enthusiastic folks (some might say snobs), of which I am one, to talk shit about manufacturers using caramel coloring (e150a) to make the product darker. Presumably it's darkened because psychologically people associate color with age and ""more flavor"". It might seem harmless, but it's a lie, and it just throws off my enjoyment of something if the color looks unnatural to me given the time I know it's spent in a barrel.

When I look at rums, it seems like nearly all of the bottles I look at exhibit a VERY dark color that is hard for me to believe is not manipulated. Am I missing something about barrel-aging in rum vs other spirits, or is color-manipulation really as widespread as it seems?

I shot a note over to the site managers of Clement USA to see if it's an option, but its been a few days and I haven't heard back.

So far I've had:

Mount Gay XO (favorite so far)

Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva (Okay for a glass but way too sweet for me)

Doorly's XO (I like it. Similar to Mount Gay XO but with a harsher finish)

Should I try Doorly's 12 Year Old? I prefer something without added sugar. I've been using [fatrumpirate.com](https://fatrumpirate.com) as a reference.

I‚Äôve had a the usual suspects, Bacardi light and dark, 151, Don Q light and dark, Captain, Captain Private Stock,and Sailor Jerry‚Äôs.  I preferred un-spiced and dark among those.  Dark Don-Q was ny favotite. 

But I am usually a whisky man.  For scotch, I love the heavy, peaty, smoky, briny Islays:  Laphroaig, Lagavullin, etc.
For boubons, I tend more towards the funky, Knob Creek and Buffalo Trace over the sweeter Woodford Reserve and Eagle Rare.  I‚Äôm not opposed to rye.  

On Monday, I‚Äôd like to try out a nice rum or two.  Nothing too sweet, please.  No syrup.  lol.  Will be drinking neat, or with water. No soft drinks, but ok with squeezed lime.

I work crazy hours on the weekend, so I most likely will not be replying until Monday, but I will read all responses.  I greatly appreciate any input, and the more leads I have to research on Monday, the better.

thelonecaner,98i9fn,8,rum,"Review #540 - TCRL Fiji ""Navy Strength"" 2009 8YO Rum","**Preamble:** This is the usual thumbnail version of the review which has pictures and the full narrative.

**Distiller:** South Pacific Distillery

**Country:** Fiji

**Bottler:** Transcontinental Rum Line (La Maison du Whiskey)

**Strength:** 57.18%

**Age:** 8 Years

**Other:** 4 Casks, 1 year tropical and 7 years continental ageing

***

**Nose:**  ¬†Aside from presenting as a fierce little young rum, it lacks something of the depth and pungency of a pot still spirit. Fine on its own merits - brine, olives, paint, turpentine, acetones, fresh nail polish, more brine and gherkins, and that‚Äôs just the beginning. ¬†It has aspects that are almost Jamaican, except that the smell is not so crisply sweet. It develops very nicely into smoke, leather, linseed oil for cricket bats, more brine and oily smoothness.

**Palate:**  Smooth and quite strong, it tasted with force and originality, like its trousers were stuffed with midichlorians. Honey, glue, bananas, followed up with pears, coffee and coconut shavings. ¬†Also, coming back to it over time, one can sense the slight syrupy sweetness of tinned peaches but with a moderating and welcome pinch (or three) of salt too. Smoke, leather, some oaky bitterness, well controlled. 
 
**Finish:** Quite original, showcasing the rum's ongoing development, nice and long, dry, fruity, thick, and briny all at once, set off by a tiny breath of salted caramel ice cream.

**Comments:** Everything about it just clicked and came together really well, and while it did display some sharper notes and serrated edges that gave away its relative youth, I quite like it for all its raw and uncouth power. The esters and the brine and fruits and oak come together in a combination that other Fijian rums have attempted, not always successfully - here it works, and works really well.

**Score:** 87

Specifically, the kind of bourbons I've usually gravitated to are Knob Creek single barrel or cask strength, or Elijah Craig small batch.

&amp;#x200B;

Second pic which I cannot upload says ""Improted by Campari UK"". Should I buy another bottle straight from Jamaica, or will this do? I collect, hence asking.",37,2018-09-04 01:41:58

BigB_117,9cpsl7,8,rum,"Ran out of Bourbon, looking for a sipping rum to pair with cigars.","I‚Äôm big cigar fan. Mostly dark spicy Nicaraguan maduro stuff. 

I usually pair them with Bourbon. Woodford Reserve, and Makers Mark 46 are some of my favorites if that gives you any ideas of what flavors I like. 

I keep reading cigars pair really will with a quality rum, so I‚Äôm looking to pick up a bottle. I think I‚Äôd prefer something without added sweetener or at least minimal sweetener. 

I‚Äôve done some poking around here, on YouTube, and reading some reviews. I‚Äôve got a small list to look for when I hit up the liquor store this week. I‚Äôll start with one bottle and explore others after that bottle is gone. 

Mount Gay XO sounds the most promising, but pairing a Nicaraguan cigar with Nicaraguan Flor de Cana rum also appeals to me.

 I‚Äôm open to any suggestions you guys might have. I have a good liquor store in town with a good selection. 

My list so far:
Mount Gay XO
Flor de Cana 18
Appleton 12
Plantation Barbados 5

766AP,8zr5r1,2,rum,"What is the 'funky' flavor in Jamaican rum, and where does it come from?","I decided to explore a 'funky' Jamaican rum recently - the Appleton 12yr - and did not like it at all.  
I was shocked that such a bizarre (and almost 'industrial' or 'medicinal') flavor is popular at all.  (I've even tried to bury whatever that flavor is by making rum-and-Cokes with it, which seemed a shame since it was a $30+ bottle, but even those taste terrible because even the Coke can't mask it.)  
  
Anyway, I couldn't place what that particular flavor was, though, and I'm curious.  What the heck is it, and/or what is it about the manufacturing process that causes it?    
  
(BTW, I'm no snob, but I'm not a total newb.  By comparison, El Dorado 15 was great (kind of like a cognac), Mount Gay XO was great (like a sweet whiskey), Zaya was way too syrupy and 1-dimensional, and Plantation XO is quite sweet but nevertheless delicious.)

* 8-10 people, all of which are at least passingly interested in rum.  I think everyone has something they like more than some common spiced. Some people still prefer flavored rums.
* .5 oz pour of each, arranged into rough flights of 2 or 3 at a time.

Rums I have enough of for that many people:

* Capucana (Cacha√ßa)
* Ypi√≥ca Prava (Cacha√ßa)
* Damoiseau VSOP (Agricola)
* Plantation - 3 Stars
* Ca√±a Brava Light
* El Dorado 5 year
* Motu
* Quackenbush Amber
* Bumbu
* Plantation - Stiggin‚Äôs Fancy Pineapple
* Doctor Bird

My questions:

1. What has worked for other people?
2. Suggestion for an order?
3. Is it ok to taste through this many different ones?
4. Worth doing some pre-printed note sheets?
5. Food suggestions  between and or before?
6. Things I should skip and/or add? (I‚Äôm not too worried about adding because I‚Äôm guessing this may be the first of many).

There remain questions about the rum, not the least of which is how can 6000 bottles be considered ""unblended"" and why is my bottle number #8693?

**Distiller:** Ginebra San Miguel

**Country:** Phillipines

**Bottler:** Bleeding Heart Rum Company

**Strength:** 50.5% (reported)

**Age:** Unknown

**Other:** Blend, probably column still. 6,000 bottles produced.

***

**Nose:**  Noses very lightly...it‚Äôs almost relaxing. Somewhat sharp, not too much, smells of sweet tinned peaches in syrup, with spices like nutmeg and cinnamon being noticeable, plus floral notes, vague salt crackers, bitter chocolate, vanilla and oatmeal cookies. ¬†(At least the thick cloying blanket of an over-sweetened liqueur that was the DP-7 does not seem to be part of the program). In its own way it‚Äôs actually quite precise and not some vague mishmash of aromas that just flow together randomly.

**Palate:**  The taste reminds one of the El Dorado 12 (not the 15, that‚Äôs a reach) - with a strong toffee, vanilla, brown sugar and molasses backbone. ¬†Lots of fruitiness here - raisins and orange peel, more of those tinned peaches - and also ginger, cinnamon, and bitter chocolate together with strong black tea. These latter tastes balance off the muskiness of the molasses and vanilla, and even if it has been sugared up (and I suspect that if it has, it is less compared to the others in the line), that part seems to be more restrained.
 
**Finish:** Surprisingly short for a rum at 50%, and sharper, mostly brown sugar, fruit syrup, caramel and chocolate, nothing new here.

**Comments:** Somewhat of a step up from the 7 and the 10. Here Bleeding Heart seem to have dispensed with the sugar shovel and used a smaller spoon, which suggests they‚Äôre paying some attention to trends in the rum world. ¬†When somebody with a hydrometer gets around to testing this thing, I hope to know for certain whether it‚Äôs adulterated or not. It's  a light-to-medium, mid-tier rum, probably five years old or less, not too complex, not too simple, with a dash of something foreign in there, but a reasonably good drink all round -- especially when compared to its siblings.

**Score:** 78

thelonecaner,8rpm1h,13,rum,Review #521 - By The Dutch Batavia Arrack,"**Preamble:** Double distilled pot still rum from Indonesia by way of Amsterdam.  This is a condensed abstract of the full essay which has  bottle photos and somewhat more narrative and background.

**Distiller:** By The Dutch

**Country:** Indonesia

**Bottler:** By The Dutch

**Strength:** 48%

**Age:** Blend of rums aged 8 months, 3 years, 5 years and 8 years

**Other:** Pot Still

***

**Nose:** Even at 48% it's remarkably soft and light, with some of that pot still action being quite evident in the initial notes: rotting banana skins, apples gone off and some funky Jamaican notes, if perhaps not as intense as a Hampden or worthy Park offering.  Plus light citrus, watery fruit and caramel hints, chamomile, cinnamon, green tea and bitter chocolate and a sort of easy sweetness.

**Palate:** Strength comes out more clearly ‚Äì not aggressive, just very solid and crisp at the same time, sweet and clear, almost like an agricole with some oak thrown in for good measure.  The pot still origins were distinct, and taste of sweet fruits gone over to the dark side were handled well: apples, citrus, pears, gherkins, the very lightest hint of olives, more tea, green grapes, with cooking spices dancing around everything, mostly nutmeg and cinnamon.  

**Finish:** Quite aromatic, lots of esters, bananas, apples, cider and a sort of grassiness that was more hinted at than forcefully explored.

**Comments:** As an alternative to more commonly available rums, this one is good to try at least once. It doesn‚Äôt smack you in the face or try to damage your glottis, and works well as both a sipping drink (if your tastes go that way), or something to chuck into a mai-tai or a negroni variation. One of the reasons why it should be tried and appreciated is because while it has tastes that suggest a Jamaican-Bajan hybrid, there is just enough variation here to make it a fascinating drink on its own merits, and shows again how rum is simply the most versatile, varied spirit available.   Plus, it‚Äôs quite a nifty rum by itself, sweet enough for those who like that, edgy enough for those who want more.

santoantao,8smry6,16,rum,Portuguese Macaronesian Rums,"Hi r/rum

I've been reading this forum and learning about the rum world the past few months. I live in Portugal, and I never really see anything mentioned about the world of Macaronesian rums. The Macaronesian islands are the island chains off the coast of Europe and Africa - Azores, Madeira, Canaries and Cabo Verde. The Canaries are dominated by the Spanish rum style, but Madeira and Cabo Verde still retain a very unique style of agricole rum, from what I have seen. I am curious if anyone is interested in this type of rum or knows much about it. In Cabo Verde, agricole rum is called ""grog"", ""grogue"", or ""grogu"" - I believe due to the British influence during the triangle trade. 

Either way, both Madeira and Cabo Verde still produce true agricole rums. In Madeira, the production experienced a severe die off in the latter part of the 20th century, but in Cabo Verde, grog (agricole rum) production is still a huge part of their local economy. I had the pleasure of visiting Santo Ant√£o island this last year, one of the major agricole rum producing islands, and the island is literally filled with hundreds of micro distillers of rum agricole - 2/3rds of the local agriculture is dedicated to sugarcane. Both of these island chains have been producing rum for over 500 years, yet receive very little international attention for this industry, as most of it is consumed locally.

Still being a relative newbie, I have to say that the agricole rums I taste out here are as good or better than the French Caribbean rums at a fraction of the price. Anyway - I have a small collection of bottles and would like to start posting up some reviews - before I started I was curious to know what the r/rum community knew about this rather small but locally significant region.

jes2xu,8snlre,3,rum,Looking for suggestions: Jamaican rum,"Hi all,  I am very new to rum and looking for perhaps 2 different rums to help me understand this little corner of the rum world (more details below if you care why).  

In short, I am hoping to find suggestions for two rums that help to show the width and breadth of flavors possible in Jamaican style rums.  Specifically, those made with heavy dark molasses (preferably blackstrap) and exhibiting at least a moderate amount of dunder funk.  

A few other caveats: 
- Mid-lowish price point (spirits are not that cheap in New Zealand)
- Widely distributed (once again, NZ)
- Not worried about getting my mind blown (I am used to funk and high proof etc) 


The why, if you can be bothered reading haha: 
Its legal to distill in NZ,  so I run a little YT channel about learning the hobby.  I am making my first rum now.  But have never really drunk much else than Bacardi (I know!).  So I would like to find a few examples to compare with and understand the possible flavor profiles.  ",31,2018-06-21 08:52:40

JustSomeBadAdvice,8uy2cw,30,rum,r/rum group buy - latest update - progress and labels!,"Hey everyone!  Got another update here with pretty much all good news.  The group buy plan is moving along.  Jonas got estimates on bottling options and we've picked a bottle(nothing too special), so now we've moved on to labeling, which is shaping up to be pretty cool I think.  /u/teejaydub and /u/ImperialSeal volunteered to do the label design since we don't want [programmer art](https://storage.googleapis.com/images.grumpygamer.com/ggart.jpg) anywhere near this.  I have a question on this at the end if people can weigh in

But first the best news: Jonas was able to find good rates on bottling and labeling, so our total cost is going to come out pretty nice, definitely under the maximum we were looking at initially.  For U.S. rum fans it is even better, as VAT doesn't apply to us AND the USD/EUR exchange rate is shifting in our favor significantly.  So, uh, thanks Trump, I guess?  This isn't bad news for EU fans though, as their costs don't increase as a result either, and they already have a lower shipping cost for the most part.  I don't want to give any estimate numbers as it is all subject to change, but right now this only looks like it could cost $100 or less for US rum fans.

As far as timeline, we'll have the label design done in a few weeks and bottling should follow after that; I'll give more info as it becomes available.  As always, thanks so much to Jonas of Fine Drams for making this happen.  Without him, wouldn't be possible.

Now for the question.  For the label design, we don't want to just call it ""r/rum's rum pick #3"".  What should we name our custom rum?  And if anyone wants to throw out any wild ideas on design, I'm sure the design guys will take that into consideration.  So brainstorm ideas.  Also since we might do this again next year if possible, each year could have a unique name or theme.  Our labeling process does give us a lot of options for cool things we can do, though we can't spend too long on the design phase - still just brainstorming.

Reddit rules disclaimer: We are not buying, selling, or trading alcohol on reddit with this group barrel selection. We are selecting our preference and our actual supplier, Fine Drams, will handle the purchasing process directly. Until I hear otherwise from an admin, we will proceed assuming this process meets the intent of the Reddit rules.

Most of the bottles seem to be IBs and most or all distilled in 1998, but there‚Äôs also the Bellevue 1821 (both a 10 year age statement expression and a less expensive NAS) that seem to be produced more regularly, or be ongoing releases of some sort.

**Distiller:** Worthy Park

**Country:** Jamaica

**Bottler:** Mezan (UK)

**Strength:** 40%

**Age:** 10 years (2005-2015)

**Other:** Independent bottling

***

**Nose:** More emphatic and distinctive than the XO. ¬†Bananas and lemons, brine, olives, vague sweetness. Time helped to some degree and after a while one could sense cherries, a little funkiness, unsweetened chocolate and a continual background of orange peel, all of which remained light and relatively unaggressive, but quite clear.

**Palate:** Light and clear...kinda flirty chirpy, even sprightly. ¬†The 40% does no damage to the palate and is actually quite pleasing in its own understated way. Green grapes, apples, cider, raspberries, tart unsweetened yoghurt, chocolate and nuts underscored by the thin line of citrus peel, and supported by a faint but noticeable set of fleshier fruits (not-quite-ripe apricots and peaches and mangoes) - the funkiness of esters was there, just dialled down, which distanced it somewhat from more traditional hard-core cask-strength Jamaicans.

**Finish:** Too short and fine, and added nothing particularly new to the fruit basket or the tastes - some citrus, cherries, green apples and that‚Äôs about it.

**Comments:** The distinctiveness of the estate profile refused to come through that general mildness, which is, of course, something of a fail mark for a country whose rums have been getting a lot of attention in the last few years. ¬†It's good and drinkable and very affordable, but a few extra points of proof would have helped a lot.

**Score:** 84

Bottled by Silver Seal

\*\*Nose\*\*:

Initial nosing reveals cough medicine. Balance of notes taken after thirty minutes rest.

Vic(Eucalyptus/camphor) Very Oily, and Industrial, cedar, mint. Gingerbread,  Sandalwood.  After more time elapses. Road tar, Clove,spice cake, old wood(between old cedar chest and used bourbon barrel) ¬† Nose is very very good. Classic Caroni

\*\*Taste\*\*

Cherry cough syrup, brown sugar.  Underpowered: Fooled by the powerful nose. Very crisp,dry.  Coats the mouth. Given the low wattage I am afraid to add water. 

Finish\*\*

Brown sugar, light mint, pepper

\*\*Score\*\*¬† 80

An easy drinking, entry level Caroni.  If this were released at 55&amp;#37; it would be a thing of beauty.  If bought at its original price I would buy for the nose alone.  At the current secondary price(over $400) I would pass and grab a Velier Caroni instead.   You can grab the 15 year for around $150.00.",0,2018-07-08 01:36:50

thelonecaner,8wzla2,10,rum,Review #526 - Compagnie des Indes Jamaica 2000 15YO Rum (Hampden),"**Preamble:** This is a condensed abstract of the full essay which has bottle photo and more narrative.

**Distiller:** Hampden Estate

**Country:** Jamaica

**Bottler:** [Compagnie des Indes](http://thelonecaner.com/compagnie-des-indes-the-company/)

**Strength:** 43%

**Age:** 15 Years

**Other:** Pot still, continentally aged, 339 bottles. 

***

**Nose:**  Jamaican rum, no question. Nose was slightly sweet, very clear, redolent of cherries, tart fruits, green apples, rotting banana funk, overripe mangoes, together with a fine line of citrus carving through the whole thing - a medium ester rum, I hazarded, crisp and clean to smell.

**Palate:** Didn‚Äôt think this could quite beat out the [CdI Worthy Park 7 YO](http://thelonecaner.com/314/), (which was half its age, though quite a bit stronger); but it definitely had more force and more uniqueness in the way it developed than the [CdI Longpond 12 YO](http://thelonecaner.com/r0479/) and the two Mezans. It started with cherries, going-off bananas mixed with a delicious citrus backbone, not too excessive. After ten minutes or so it opened further into a medium sweet set of fruits (peaches, pears, apples), and showed notes of oak, cinnamon, some brininess, green grapes, all backed up by delicate florals that were very aromatic.

**Finish:**  The tastes on the palate provided a good background for the finish, which glided along to a relatively serene, slightly heated medium-long stop, though with little more than what the palate had already demonstrated.  Fruitiness and some citrus and cinnamon was about it. 

**Comments:** Overall, a solid, tasty Jamaican rum, presenting somewhat younger than its physical years. ¬†Some of its rough edges were sanded away while leaving enough to give it some character: its strength was right, I think, and it lacked some of the furious brutality of younger ester bombs from the estates, without losing any of its elemental character. A very pleasant sipping dram that retains just enough edge to make it a very good experience to have by itself, or to perk up whatever cocktail you feel like adding it to.

**Score:** 86

TakingOnWater,8xf6xt,10,rum,"Anyone ever make something similar to a white russian, but with a nice dark rum?","Hey all,

Been somewhat getting into darker-ish rums lately. Haven't had anything too special yet, but bought a bottle of Cruzan Black Strap and actually really like it. I know it's cheap, and probably a little sweet compared to better rums, but it's solid and I'm able to sip it neat/on ice, and it seems to mix fairly well too, as long as you don't add too much extra sugar/syrup to a drink.

Anyway, I've always loved white russians, and was wondering if anyone has a recipe variant for something like it that uses dark rum? Wondering if I should just literally use a normal WR recipe and replace vodka with the Cruzan, or if there are any other fun tips to making it another way to accent the rum more.

Thanks and cheers!",9,2018-07-10 03:27:58

zillah1985,8xszpj,0,rum,"So, is rum like, so hot right now?","Foursquare, stop trying to make rum happen. It will never happen. 

I am getting asked by whiskey enthusiasts recently about rum. ""You drink rum at all?"" 

You mean the daiquiris I have been making since I was a wee lad? Strawberries and lime juice and ice in the blender type shit? Love that shit. Bitches love that shit. Substituting me Old Monk for black strap in my Mai Tai's yes sir; or an Aged Appleton cuz I love the funk; or a Mount Gay that I have to explain is no, not gay when I say, drink this XO. It's decent; while I got the bottle of Rhum Barbancourt 15 in the back room draped in a Hawaiian shirt.

""Nah, Foursquare.""

Oh, you mean properly priced cask strength aged rum with no additives. Like...not spending $100 plus just to get all those other IBs with agricole, barbados, guadalupe, or whatever else is out there. Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah that shit is good.

""Yah man, rum, is like so hot right now.""

No it ain't. Rum is a fucking mess. An amazing mess, but it will never happen. Stop trying to make rum happen. People are running around having to put eyedroppers in samples to test their ABVs just so they know their junk isn't being fucked around with.

I like the idea that Rum is getting the right idea about how to make some high quality spirit, but I feel like when you say ""Rum"" you are not including what I think of ""Rum."" Why don't you just say Foursquare already. 

Cuz yah man, Foursquare, so hot right now.

**Distiller:** Sancti Spiritus

**Country:** Cuba

**Bottler:** Kill Devil (Hunter Laing)

**Strength:** 46%

**Age:** 17 Years

**Other:** Column still, continentally aged, 362 bottles. Single cask.

***

**Nose:**  Quite sharp to begin with - perhaps a surprise to those who are used to softer, milder Bacardis as ‚ÄúCuban style‚Äù exemplars. Cherries, peaches and tart soursop, unsweetened yoghurt, vanilla, oak, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a very faint line of citrus running through the whole thing.

**Palate:**  Less creamy than the nose. Clean in the mouth, tasting of green grapes, apples, cider, mixed up with something of the saliva-flooding crisp tartness of red currants, or lemons just starting to go off. What made it stand out was the background notes of light flowers,caramel, vanilla, bananas, ginnips, and wet dark brown sugar, plus those spices again, mostly cinnamon. 

**Finish:**  Quite elegant: light caramel and fudge, oakiness and vanilla, with a little citrus for bite. 

**Comments:** It lacked a certain roundness and smooth planing away of rough edges, but I suggest that‚Äôs a good thing - it made it its own rum rather than a milquetoast please-as-many-as-you-can commercial product you‚Äôll forget tomorrow morning. Also, it seemed to steer a course somewhere between a light molasses column still rum, and the grassier and more vegetal notes of an agricole...without actually leaning towards either one. But that's the part I liked, because it gave the thing some personality.

What gives? Is the producer just making much more of this now, is it no longer difficult to obtain or has the quality dropped?

thelonecaner,8y94he,12,rum,Review #528 - Velier Courcelles 1972 31 Year Old Rhum Vieux (42%),"**Preamble:** This is a condensed abstract of the full essay which has bottle photo and some opinions and background notes for the historically minded. Note also the companion review of the [54% version of the same rum](http://thelonecaner.com/r0395/)

**Distiller:** Domaine de Courcelles

**Country:** Marie Galante, Guadeloupe

**Bottler:** [Velier](http://thelonecaner.com/velier/)

**Strength:** 42%

**Age:** 31 Years

**Other:** Column still, continentally aged, outturn unknown.

***

**Nose:**  Lovely and sweet, light without actually being delicate. It presents bags of light fruit ‚Äì pears, ripe apples, watermelons, cherries ‚Äì that go on forever, to which are added soft red-wine notes, honey, thyme and a drizzle of hot caramel on vanilla ice cream.  The scents grow richer over time in spite of its relatively low proof point and their overall mildness.

**Palate:**  Clear and clean notes of light fruitiness ‚Äì pears again, watermelon again, some grapes, raisins and ripe mangoes, set off by softer nuances that speak of nougat, white chocolate, a flirt of coffee, rosemary, caramel, vanilla, thyme and some florals. It also has a background of honey that I quite enjoy with a profile like this because it strengthens the whole in a quiet kind of way, provides a bed for the rest of the flavours to emerge onto and do their thing. 

**Finish:**  About the weakest point of the whole experience -- short and faint, a zephyr following from a stiff breeze, with just some barely discernible floral and fruity hints and a bit of orange zest and tart yoghurt, and then it‚Äôs all over. 

**Comments:** Interesting how differently it presents when rated against the 54% version ‚Äì it‚Äôs like they are different branches from the tree (many of the tasting components, for example, are quite similar). The 42% iteration, I have to somewhat reluctantly note, is less when placed next to its masterful stronger sibling.  On its own, with nothing else to compare it to, it‚Äôs quietly, subtly brilliant and will not disappoint the casual drinker. But side by side, its potential clarion call is muted and dialled down, it is deferential and says much less‚Ä¶and when it does, it whispers

If we do that, we'll explicitly avoid any bourbon-inspired rums for that tasting, so next year we'll select something very different (and *also* very good!).

So, our next step is to start thinking about label designs.  Fine Drams is getting some bottling quotes and may have some options for us there, and that'll guide the label format/size/etc.  It would be good if we did a simple but unique label for our bottle, so if anyone wants to start thinking about this, please PM me.  I did get one message from someone offering way back, but I've forgotten his name (will look it up if I need to, quite a bit of scrolling lol).

Happy days!  And thanks again to all of the tasting committee for their excellent notes!


If you are not already included in the reddit rum buy and want to, fill out [this form with a reddit username and email,](https://goo.gl/forms/TrueJ6rin5WEbarp2) as that is my master participant list.  The price will probably come out near or slightly over $100 after shipping to the U.S., though we can save on shipping by buying more items.

thirdguess,8nt2f2,5,rum,Suggestion request,"So my liquor chops are mostly in the whisky world, but I have dabbled elsewhere... As far as what I'm looking for, I enjoy a wide range of flavor profiles, so feel free to suggest multiples! I am looking to start at or below $40 for a bottle. My understanding is that I can spend significantly less in the rum world than I would on bourbon, which of course I can spend less on than I would on scotch, so I'm hoping that is a decent start. I am an avid cigar smoker, and would love something besides whiskey to sip on, spice of life and all. Definitely a neat drinker, but I'm not one of those people who needs something more relatable to whiskey to ""get rum,"" I wanna dive right in to what's loved by the rum afficianado! Bonus points if I can easily get it at my local mega liquor Mart (I will try at my small local store first of course, I'm not a monster) I'm in Chicagoland so it's binnys.

A couple suggestions I have been given -

* Pussers 15 - this might be above my target amount, and I'm not sure how easily attainable it is.

* El Dorado 12 - I know I can easily get this",11,2018-06-02 00:02:26

**Country:**Japan
**Bottler:**Nine Leaves
**Strength:**50%
**Age: **6 Months
**Other:**Pot Still

***

**Nose:**Wet stone and minerals (!!), salt, sweet peas, before relaxing with the weird stuff and presenting something a tad more traditional ‚Äì sherry, brine, an olive or two, watermelon, pears and a light kind of sweetness that‚Äôs quite pleasing.  And quite assertive, but without actually crossing over into rough.

**Palate:** Deceptive: dominating flavour at first sip was swank and a freshly sliced watery pear, then it evolved subtly over time. Once it opened up, brine, olives, gherkins, cucumbers to start, mellowing out into light fruits, a bit of lemon zest, nutmeg (very faint), guavas and just a suggestion of creaminess I could not nail down more precisely.

**Finish:**rather short for something bottled at 50%, and was quite dry, somewhat less than nose and palate suggested could be found. Some watery fruits, a bit of brine, the sweet line of citrus and spice

**Comments:** The key to the experience is in understanding its rather unstudied and deliberate eschewing of off-the-wall complexity.  Although it‚Äôs two steps above merely ‚Äúsimple‚Äù it‚Äôs also clear and crisp and has the notes it plays, and plays those exceedingly well. I quite enjoyed it.

**Nose:** Hints of a funky kind of fruitiness at the beginning (like a low rent Jamaican, perhaps), while the characteristic clarity and crisp individualism of the aromas such as the other Nine Leaves rums possessed, remained. ¬†It was musky and sweet, had some zesty citrus notes, fresh apples, pears.

**Palate:** Some sugar water, vanilla, cereals and those spices again, cider and apple juice. ¬†No brine here, no olives, more like a kind of tartness, akin to unsweetened fresh yoghurt. And a minerally iodine peat-bog taste lurked in the background, which fortunately stayed there and wasn‚Äôt so aggressive as to derail the experience. ¬†Quite smooth, with some edge and rawness, well controlled

**Finish:** Quiet, clear and relatively easy, redolent mostly of acidic fruits, apples, cider, oranges and a bit of vanilla.

**Comments:** Yummy. It provided reasonable complexity, clarity, enjoyment, and retained its sprightly youth and vigour while suggesting how the ageing sanded off the rough edges. ¬†For a two year old rum made on the other side of the world, this thing is quite an achievement.

JustSomeBadAdvice,8dff9e,23,rum,Rum buy update: Need to select a replacement taster,"Hey guys, so slight problem we've encountered.  The samples will be on their way to me soon from Fine Drams!  Unfortunately we won't be able to work out the logistics to get the tasting samples to TheLoneCaner in time due to his particular situation.  So we need to select a 4th taster.  (/u/TwiddleDD, /u/quazi4moto, and the group of [t8ke, tailg8r, texacer, rustypipes] are our current tasting committee)

The next in line by votes was /u/ODMBitters, who actually didn't fill out the form to be included in the rum buy.  If ODMBitters wants it and will be a part of the group buy, it will probably go to them.

After them, it's a tie (down to just two votes) so we'd have to have people vote.  The people who got two nominations each are: /u/MonsieurZaccone, /u/throwboats, /u/troyk890 and myself.

I don't need to be a taster and probably wouldn't do a good job - I've never written tasting notes and haven't actually tried a variety of non-sweetened rums to compare against.  So I'm dropping out of the list.

Alternatively with so few votes, we could nominate and vote for (with username mentions, upvotes are not a reliable measure IMO) someone else as the 4th taster.

I'll collect any feedback or votes on what to do, and/or ODMBitters can respond here and confirm he would like to participate in the buy/tasting.",9,2018-04-19 23:19:20
OhMyGuardian,8djx3l,5,rum,Rum Punch Recipe Help,"So I'm trying to make a good Punch for a birthday party and was going to go with this Trader Vic's Punch:

* 24 Oranges
* 24 Lemons
* 6oz orgeat
* 6oz simple syrup
* 1.25 liter light rum
* 1.25 liter dark rum

So besides the complete hassle of the math behind the fruit it just doesn't seem right...

When taken down to a one glass format I get this in ounces (estimate that each fruit yeilds 3oz..
 Or I use Simply Orange and Simply Lemon:

* 36 oz orange - 3oz
* 36 oz lemon - 3oz
* 6 orgeat - .5oz
* 6 simple syrup - .5oz
* 38.0415 light - 3.17oz
* 38.0415 dark - 3.17oz 

I'm struggling with the thought that this printed recipe from the Total Tiki app is just... Off somehow. It either needs way more juice or half that amount of alcohol.

And thoughts would help, and I'll try to improve formatting when I'm home.

I have also got a bottle of Papa Pilar dark which I liked, but less.  I tend toward the sweet side and cost (within reason) is not an object.  Anyone have recomendations?",21,2018-04-25 01:37:24

I added in a bit of Mezcal along the way. When I say ""try"" I mean drinking and enjoying the spirit neat, rather than in a drink.  I always liked rum based drinks, Captain Morgan and I are well acquainted back to my college days, but I've not had it in year.   

Now as I start looking at where my mix of spirit purchases and consumption are trending, I've gone from maybe two bottle of good rum at this time last year, to 10 bottles now.  I'm shrinking the bourbons and ryes I have on hand and the Scotches.  I have decided (quite recently) that I'd rather dive deeper into rum than to explore Mezcal much further.  

I know this is r/Rum, but I'm curious whether some of you were always rum fans and are perhaps trying other spirits or did you follow a path more like mine?  Is rum trending up or down on your list? ",24,2018-05-09 04:30:53

Beginning of Feb, I was in Las Vegas, I stopped at Total Wines and got a bottle of vodka to bring back and a bottle of rum.

The bottle of rum I brought back was Plantation XO 20th Annv. I was in one of the private liquor stores here at home and while I was in there this afternoon, I saw that they are now selling Plantation XO 20th Annv. Bought it for $53USD, they are selling it here for $90CAD.

Note: reason why I said 'private' is because the gov't heavily regulates liquor sales here, and all the liquor stores were gov't run until just a few years ago that private stores were allowed to start operating, and now we have a handful around here

JustSomeBadAdvice,85ydik,27,rum,Group buy survey - Full data,"Hi again everyone.  Finally tabulated all the data from the spreadsheet.

So starting out, here's the data I didn't have counted up for my [last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/8509qd/quick_update_on_survey_group_buy/)

Tasting committee, if we are able to do one:  **Thelonecaner** won the most nominations.  Tied after that was **texacer, t8ke, and TwiddleDD**.  As **texacer, t8ke, rustypipes, and tailg8r** are all local to eachother, they will be involved in the tasting committee as a group, giving us a nice set of reviews.  **TwiddleDD** rounds out the group with both several nominations and also tastes matching those not covered by the others.  Honorable mention: Quazi4Moto also tied everyone else listed for second, but unfortunately his tastes are similar to Thelonecaner's, so I'm skipping him to maintain the diversity of the tasting committee (unless we can have a larger committee than I'm expecting).

Brand/name examples: This was quite interesting.  To count these, I counted all votes for one ""brand"" as the same.  So if you put ""Foursquare Bourbon Barrel Cask Strength"" that counted as ""Foursquare.""

1. Foursquare - 23 votes.
2. Plantation - 16 votes.
3. El Dorado - 13 votes.
4. Hampden - 10 votes.
5. Appleton - 10 votes.
6. Mount Gay - 9 votes.
7. Smith &amp; Cross - 8 votes.

As far as counting only the ""specific"" callouts, Foursquare 2004 won.

Based on this, I feel much more comfortable moving forward with the *""no or almost no additives""* vote.  Even for those of us who favor El Dorado, trying something different of good quality will be good for us, and the tasting committee is diverse enough to have it covered.

Origin locations:

1. Jamaica - 58 votes.
2. Barbados - 47 votes.
3. Guyana - 34 votes.
4. Martinique - 18 votes.

Information about the additives results, price results, and other little tidbits is in [my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/8509qd/quick_update_on_survey_group_buy/)  In addition, the really curious can dig through the [raw redacted data here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ffr1jts5LbYxG6TSS5jxUE2laQThNcrgrbIjDoYCd44/edit?usp=sharing)  Note I didn't include the nominations as that data would require more cleaning; If someone is really curious I can redact/clean that data to remove identifying information.

If I get **at least ~~8~~ 7 messages from people who previously listed $100 or lower as their maximum price that say they are ok to bump it to $110,** we'll set the maximum price at $110 to get a better quality result.  Otherwise we'll make the maximum price $100 to be more inclusive rather than less.  Small difference probably, but I'd rather avoid excluding people if possible.

This will be the basis of our request then.  After a few days for comment, I'll start following up with suppliers, primarily Fine Drams / E&amp;A Sheer, to see what we can make happen.  This will be a slow process.  Here's how I'm thinking of wording it:

&gt; We're seeking a cask-strength rum priced between $50 and $100 per bottle, looking to buy about 180-250 bottles depending where the price comes out.  We prefer as few additives as possible, though small amounts are tolerable.  Ideally 12 years of aging, but anything above 5 years is acceptable.  Prefer pot still and non-chill filtered if possible.  Favorite source locations for this community-driven buy were Jamaica, Barbados, and Guyana, and favorite brands were Foursquare, Hampden, Smith &amp; Cross, Plantation, El Dorado, and Appleton.  It would be nice if we can add a custom label in addition to any normal labeling, if possible, simply reflecting the Reddit community driven nature of our purchase.

Open to any wording changes/suggestions to the above that anyone has.

If you come late to this party and still want in, feel free to fill out [the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/TrueJ6rin5WEbarp2) to get added to the list of interested people.

TheBoredEngineer,86spj4,4,rum,"New to the world of rum, looking for recommendations","Hi all, recently got into rum and find myself completely lost as to what bottles to try.


So far I've been having mostly spiced rum (captain morgan, kraken and sailor jerry, in order of preference) but I bought a bottle of Mount Gay Eclipse last night. 


I found it had a distinct chemical smell compared to my usual Sailor Jerry and on top of that gave me pretty nasty shits this morning (may have been more to do with quantity than quality, I'm not a doctor) 


So now I am hoping to tap into your collective wealth of experience to find me my next bottle which 

1) is easily available in the UK (Tesco/Sainsburys/Amazon UK)

2) doesn't make me feel like I'm drinking cheap vodka

3) won't have me eating tinned beans until my next paycheck


Thanks in advance! (jabs at my preference for spiced rum are encouraged) ",20,2018-03-24 20:27:09

I recently came back from a trip to Madeira (Belongs to Portugal, located near Canary Islands and Morocco). Originally I had planned to bring back home a bottle of Havana Club 7 years old, but I trashed the plan because I could get that from a local liquor store as well. 

Instead, I bought a bottle of *some* Madeiran made rum I know absolutely nothing about. At just 21‚Ç¨ per bottle it wasn't the cheapest one on the shelf, but it was on the low-end.

whiskyrookie,8bj7ia,7,rum,Tried Zacapa 23 neat. Wasn't wowed... am I doing something wrong?,"Hi... whiskey drinker here. 

I bought a bottle of Ron Zacapa 23 Centurion Rum based on several positive reviews I read and saw on YouTube.

Tried it last night neat in a glencairn. I found it one dimensional and flat. I just got notes of burnt sugar... which I usually like, but it wasn't very complex.

Tried it with a large cube of ice. Was a bit better. Tasted softer.

But overall I wasn't wowed. Am I doing something wrong?

Did I pick the wrong rum? ",17,2018-04-12 02:07:43
fullofdust,8bj99j,6,rum,Clement VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux Questions,"I've been diving more into the world of rum lately due to the usual gateway drug of tiki. I picked up a bottle of Clement VSOP Rhum Agricole Vieux, which is my first agricole I've had outside of a cocktail. It's left me a little baffled and I'm wondering if others can provide some insight. 

It tastes like cognac with a grassy aftertaste. The grassy notes make sense given how agricole is produced, and though odd for my palate, I actually dig that part. However I get zero flavors or aromas that I normally associate with rum/rhum. It's all cognac and whiskey to me. And not even good cognac or whiskey. Though I'm sure it'll be fine in a cocktail, it's got me questioning my $40 bottle purchase. 

So I suppose my question would be: is this bottle typical of agricole or is it an outlier? If it's an odd duck, I'd love some recommendations on more typical agricole and agricole vieux. ",6,2018-04-12 02:13:40

To mark the occasion, I think it's time we get a new banner for the top of the page, but the problem is, I have the talent and ability of a wet piece of cardboard. 

I'm calling on anyone here to please submit your design or ideas for a new banner - I don't know what filetype, picture size, etc. are even required, but someone must. 

Let's spruce the place up! I'll make sure that whoever's banner we use gets the proper recognition.

JustSomeBadAdvice,807g3p,20,rum,Rum /r/rum labeled Group buy update #1,"Hi everyone, making a new thread to keep organized.  [This was](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/7zu2qq/can_we_do_this_would_be_amazing/) the original.  At this point it is clear to me that there's enough interest to make this happen if it can.  So now onto the next steps...

The logistical difficulties of arranging all this have started to hit me - There's no way I can ship these out myself for legal reasons as well as simple logistics.  I'm going to see what/who I can find that might be able to help us and could use any help, especially if anyone has any connections to make this happen.

#\#1 problem - Shipping logistics.

At the rate interest is growing, we may well be able to buy an entire barrel, about 250 bottles.  Which is great because it is enough interest that we might convince a distillery to work with us to make this happen!  But not great for logistics, them's a lot of bottles of liquor.  About 80% of the interest is coming from US based Redditors.

I've reached out to the Redditor with FineDrams, /u/Scotch_Fanatic, to see what help they can provide.  If nothing else they might be able to provide the international shipping logistics, maybe for the U.S. as well (with higher shipping costs and a low chance of customs problems).  I've also tried emailing liquorama, one of the largest US online liquor sellers, to see if they might be willing to help with US shipping logistics - They're able to ship to all but 5 U.S. states at US rates(state taxes apply).

If anyone has any connections or otherwise that could help with logistics, please contact me or reply here.

#\#2 problem - Distillery cooperation.

What Four Roses did with /r/Bourbon a few years ago was awesome, and it seems not something that would happen today through them.  However, I'm hopeful that we can find a quality rum distillery that would work with us on this custom order.  A custom or modified label would be ideal, but not required.  My next plan is to try reaching out to some of the major rum connoisseurs that do reviews and/or judge events who seem to be well connected - hopefully one of them would both see how cool this would be for us and also be able to put us in touch with the right people to maybe make it happen.  If that doesn't go anywhere, I'll try the rum distilleries directly.

So, that said, does anyone have any contacts, direct or indirect, for a rum distillery that might work with us on this purchase?  Barring that, I'm open to suggestions of the distilleries to contact asking - El Dorado, Diplomatico, and Angostura come to mind personally, but the more we contact the better our chances of finding one to work with us.

\#3 problem - organizing the specifics of the group buy, tasting committee if applicable, and collecting funds.  These all seem like easier obstacles that I can work through when we get there.  So the first step would be to see if I can find a way to accomplish #1 and #2, then I'll resume identifying the specific interest on a person-by-person basis.

I'll keep maintaining a list of interested parties for the group buy separately, and make a new thread about that when we get to that point.  So if you want your name added to the list, reply directly to me somewhere so I see it, but there's no rush as that list won't be finalized for a bit.

Thanks everyone!",42,2018-02-26 05:04:28
rteyistoenr,808ewh,3,rum,So this happened to me the other day.....,"I spent a week in Belize. I left there Wed (21st) and got home Thurs (22nd). I bought a bottle of rum in duty free in the the airport. It was a bottle of Don Omario Vintage 15-year. The woman at the counter, put it in the pretty red velvet bag for me. Then wrapped that in 2 (or 3, I can't remember) layers of newspaper, then put that into a grey plastic bag. They don't seal the bag when you purchase in duty free in Belize City. So, since I was already past security, I got to carry it on the plane for my first flight. I still had 2 more flights to go. I get into Toronto, go through customs, and I get my checked bag. Now, since its not a sealed bag, I have to put it into my checked bag before I give up my bag for my second flight. Before I put into onto the conveyor belt, I ask them to put a 'Fragile' tag onto my bag. I get off my second flight, grab my bag, and I have an 8 hour (overnight) layover. I get my bag tag printed and give my bag up for my third and final flight home, again I had them put a 'Fragile' tag onto my bag. I now get home, open my bag up to start to un-pack. I grab a couple pieces of clothes out and then I grab my bottle of rum, and get a faint smell of rum. Uh-Oh. I pull it out, but I still feel some weight. I un-wrap it, and see that I'm missing 1-2 ounces out of there. And now I look in my suitcase to see how much spilt in it. None. Luckily the stuff that did seep out, got soaked up by the newspaper and the red, velvet bag. Whew. It smelt, really good. And then I did a quick sip from the bottle. Tasted, decent for the first sip. Haven't had the time to really enjoy it yet. A couple hours later, I looked at it closer, and the cork they used, was tearing away from the wooden cap. 

So, it could've been A LOT worse for me, but I still lost some rum. ",4,2018-02-26 07:22:44

I know that I'm looking for a sipper for begginers , I ordered diplomatico exclusive reserve but I do wanna listen to more offers , I LOVED the plantation and el dorado 12 Could see myself sipping a 120ml on a rough day , I know its maybe a lot? or not but I really liked the taste of it.

anax44,81rjqt,7,rum,Whatever Happened to 10 Cane Production in Barbados?,"When I developed an interest in rum, it was a bit too late to readily find any 10 Cane rum on shelves.

Discussion of the rum came up often though.

Across the internet, most people seemed to like the rum a lot or at the very least find it interesting. 

Eventually I came across a rumor that 10 Cane rum had plans on moving production from Trinidad to Barbados. 

I was expecting a new series of 10 Cane to be hitting the shelves soon until last year when I was at [Foursquare Distillery](http://cestlavibe.com/visiting-the-foursquare-rum-distillery-heritage-park/) and I was told that there would be no new Foursquare produced 10 Cane.

Yesterday, I came across [this article](http://rumlocker.com/2018/03/02/barbados-sand-sun-rum-sugar-and-foursquare/) on the Rum Locker where the writer spends the early part talking about 10 Cane Rum.

To somewhat summarize that section; the author considered 10 Cane to be one of his favorite rums, but then Richard Seale told him that he was the first person he knew of who liked the rum, and he didn't want his name and reputation attached to the rum.

The author then goes on to pour a dram of a former favorite and he now finds it entirely unremarkable.


I decided to look into detail into where the rumor that 10 Cane was moving to Barbados to see where it started and I found an article on [The Trinidad Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.tt/business/2013-05-30/angostura10-cane-rum-did-not-bring-sufficient-returns), and another on [Caribbean 360](http://www.caribbean360.com/news/barbados_news/barbados-welcomes-new-rum-agreement-to-produce-quot-10-cane-quot).

Some quotes from both articles;

 &gt; ""Part of the operations for 10 Cane rum was actually closed for a few years because of insufficient demand. We worked with their team on relocation and wish them all the success in the future""


Angostura Representative

 &gt; ""This brand has the short potential to sell in the region of two to three hundred thousand cases and to become a major global brand when you want it to sell a million cases""


Richard Seale

 &gt; ""I commend the Chairman and management of Foursquare Distilleries for their work in getting us to this point today where we can really boast and celebrate this new contract being worked out with Hennessy""


Donville Inniss - Barbados Industry Minister

 &gt; ""Barbados‚Äô gain over T&amp;T""


David Seale


Foursquare seemed real excited at one point to be moving forward with 10 Cane production. I wonder what happened?

Also, I wonder why LVMH never found another producer for it?",5,2018-03-04 01:30:12

obeythehypnotoad,82lg9o,5,rum,Bacoo 8 year mini review,"Picked up a bottle of [Bacoo 8 year](http://bacoorum.com/products/#product2) at a local liquor shop.  I think I paid around $25.  I took a gamble as there's not much recorded online about this brand.

This is a Dominican Republic product and according to the website is made from locally grown cane juice (not molasses).  If I had to describe it in a sentence I would say it's a Central American version of Barbancourt 8.  It's got that cane juice vegetal stuff going on.  I hesitate to refer to this as an agricole but in a technical sense I guess it is.

There is a *lot* going on in this rum.  It's on the dry side but sips easily .  It's got a lot of different flavors going on but lacks any obvious oak flavor.  I find this refreshing.  The finish is a little peppery.  Overall very nice and I think the flavors blend together nicely.

It's bottled in a lovely bottle with a nice cork and includes a little note explaining the meaning of the Bacoo name.  Apparently Bacoo is some sort of genie in the bottle type mythological being.  I think the bottling is a very nice touch in this price range.  Pays off for them too, it practically jumped out at me in the middle of dozens of rums.

Their website has a statement regarding age:  ""Bacoo aged rum provides the consumer with a known quality aged product without deception by providing legitimate age statements. When we say 5, 8 and 12, we mean it.""  They could still be lying but it's a good sign that they are up front about their products.

I only really believe in one scoring system.  Will I buy this again?  Absolutely.",1,2018-03-07 12:07:42

I'm collecting opinions so we have a well-formed request for what we would like for our private barrel.  In particular, this will determine the price range and size of our order, so ***[if you are interested, please participate](https://goo.gl/forms/TrueJ6rin5WEbarp2)*** at least the required questions.

All the non-required questions will be used to create our parameters and form a tasting committee(if we have that option).  I've *tried* to both cover all the major points and still keep it short.  If a question isn't required, you can always leave it blank if you don't know or don't care.

#Questionnaire here: https://goo.gl/forms/TrueJ6rin5WEbarp2

I'll give this post a day or two for everyone to use it, then I'll go down my list and ping the interested people who haven't filled it out.  I currently have 115 interested redditors on my list.

Afterwards, I'll average / analyze the data and make a new post with what people preferred and see about moving forward

TheMaskedMagician,83l5e2,19,rum,Mount Gay XO,"Hey everyone

I‚Äôve been a scotch/bourbon drinker for some time and recently decided to broaden my horizon and buy a bottle of Rum. 

My only previous experience with Rum has been with cheap highball nights at clubs/pubs. 

After reading this subreddit a bit and based on my local selection I went with the Mount Gay Xo. 

I first tried it neat in a glencairne glass and it was pretty tasty. Vanilla essence, molasses, and brown sugar would be the flavours that came to mind. I was interested to find it wasn‚Äôt as sweet as I pictured it would be. 

Later on I had guests over and made some rum and cokes on ice. Hands down, the best rum and coke I‚Äôve ever had. This Rum melded with the coke on a spiritual level - the sweet carbonated drink it became was almost to good for the simple rum and coke namesake. Furthermore as  if to enforce this fact, I noticed the foam from the coke didn‚Äôt seem to go away. The Rum seemed to halt the process by which the bubbles dissipate and this delicious layer of foam settled and stayed above the ice. 

Never seen that with any rum and coke I‚Äôve had before. All in all fantastic. Will always stock this.  ",15,2018-03-11 14:31:03

LisneyDand,84ki1a,6,rum,Novice rum drinker: Bacardi vs Koloa,"I bought a bottle of Koloa coconut, my first bottle of rum, a month or two ago and thought it was nice.  Today I tried a shot of Bacardi mango and was kind of disgusted.   In response, my boyfriend (who bought the bottle on clearance for a few bucks) informed me that Bacardi is for mixing.  I don't have too much experience with mixed drinks, but when I *have* made cocktails, I've always dipped into a bottle of something that I enjoy neat.  As such this was the first time that I've had something straight that is 'for mixing.'

Is it point of Bacardi being so nasty when neat that it is intended to be diluted?  Like how soy sauce would be disgusting if you just drank a glug of it, but tastes great when used as a condiment? Or is Bacardi just bad?  I have yet to try it in a cocktail, but - when consumed neat - it tasted someone poured hawaiian punch into a bottle of rubbing alcohol.",10,2018-03-15 14:48:28

JustSomeBadAdvice,8509qd,30,rum,Quick update on survey / group buy,"Just a quick update here.  I've taken a snapshot of [the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/TrueJ6rin5WEbarp2) data.  If anyone still wants to get in on this, they should fill out the survey with their username, but their choices won't affect our request anymore (though location will still be helpful for shipping, and number of bottles desired).  We also got an offer from a helpful Redditor to design a label for us, if such a thing is possible in our group buy.

I'm analyzing the data now.  A bit tired tonight so I'll have to finish it tomorrow - Several categories of the items need to be normalized for spelling/wording before I can count them.  But I thought I'd give the quick data now as a teaser, and the full data post tomorrow-ish.

We got 165 responses to the survey.

**For the ""additives acceptable"" question,** the answers are split with most favoring no additives.  47% said they wanted NO additives, 34% don't care, and 19% said additives are ok.

For the 31 (19%) that said additives are ok, the survey asked them another question, with options for (""As few as possible"", ""sugar ok"", ""color ok"" and ""Other/Any ok"").  Of those 31, 21 indicated that they wanted as few additives as possible, or 2/3rds.

However, I'm hesitant to count those percentages exactly as written, as there were quite a few people who indicated no or few additives and then went on to list a rum in the ""what you imagine this tasting like"" field that I know to have a ton of added sugar.  Four of the ""No additives"" people did that, as well as four of the ""as few as possible"" group and eight of the ""don't care"" group.  Whatever I find from the data tomorrow, we'll be leaning at least towards ""as few additives as possible"".  So this won't end up being an highly sugary-sweet request we make.

**Price:  For our minimum price,** the median and average both came out around $50.  21 people put $20 or $25 - sorry, no way is that going to work, that barely covers shipping.

**For our maximum price,** the average was $119 and the median was $110.  When I clamp the top 10 and bottom 10 values together to remove outliers($500, lol) the average is still $116.  If the maximum is $100, 121 people will participate.  If the maximum is $110, that drops to 83.  I'm fine with doing a maximum of either $100 per bottle or $110, but leaning towards $100 to be more inclusive.

**Continental aging:**  People didn't care.  16% did, but we'll go with what we can get for the best price/age/etc.

**Pot Still:** 43% cared.  It'll be a preference but not a requirement.

**Non-chill-filtered:** 45% cared.  Same thing, preference but not required.

**Cask Strength:** 3 people said they preferred weaker.  21% didn't care.  The overwhelming majority either preferred or required it.  Our request will be for basically cask strength or equivalent.

More data tomorrow - it'll take me time to normalize the variety of entries.  Fortunately it looks like we got plenty of nominations to select a good tasting committee from.",14,2018-03-17 08:45:29

fgsgeneg,7w65ne,12,rum,Sipping Rums at One Hundred Proof or More,"I'm coming to rum from the bourbon world where I prefer bourbons of at least 100 proof with a few 90+ proofers thrown in. Most bourbons between 80 and 90 proof have too little alcohol to drive the flavors home and generally are unintersting because of this problem. Recently in r/bourbon a short discussion of rum broke out and I thought I would like to check out the rum options. I joined r/rum and lurked for a few days mostly seeing what people drank neat since I'm mostly a neat drinker and decided on a bottle of Doorly's 12 yr. I liked it quite a bit, but it has the same problem underproofed bourbon has, I had to work hard at pulling out the flavors. They just weren't as in your face as a good bourbon is and so I began to think about rums in the 100 to 130 proof range. Are there any good sippers at a reasonable price in this range of proofs?

Sexandcheesecake,7w8qc8,3,rum,White Rum Amatuer,"Hey guys,

I am looking for a decent white rum. Most of the local liquor stores/grocery liquor stores around here only carry Bacardi, Captain Morgan White Rum and Havana Club but I have a big liquor store 30 minutes away that has a HUGE selection. I haven't been able to find much information online, except for lists and I would like to talk to actual human beings about their preferences.

I LOVE Classic Daiquiris but I have only used Bacardi before and I feel like I am doing the drink a disgrace by using it.

I am open to sipping (I like bourbon, scotch, vodka neat) but I know Bacardi doesn't give me a good look at what a white rum should taste like.

Any recommendations $25 and under? What about over $25?",18,2018-02-09 06:25:44

funkthulhu,7x39u9,10,rum,"Started a ""Solera"" bottle for fun.","I don't know about you, but most of my pours are 2 oz straight, or various odd amounts for getting my Tiki on.  This means I often have several bottles that are below 10% full.  Sometimes, not even enough for a 2 oz pour.  So I got out a tighter-sealing decanter with a wide bottom and narrow neck, and emptied all my dying soldiers into it.  Now I have about half a bottle of ""solera"" rum that is, quite frankly, amazing.  

I have seen this done with Bourbon and other brown liquor, so I gave it a shot.  It also reduces surface area that each separate bottle would have and lowers the oxidation rate.  This way nothing ever goes to waste and I can have a rotating home-brand that is always interesting.  

So, how about you?  Do you have a decanter of dregs to sample?  Questions, comments, short stories?  ",19,2018-02-13 03:28:05

Cremacious,7kuohl,2,rum,Siesta Key Spiced Rum. A local must have.,"[Bottle](https://i.imgur.com/yEF4lYj.jpg)

Siesta Key Spiced Rum is a handcrafted rum that is not only a great tasting rum and my new go-to, but it is also a local product here in Sarasota, FL. Their distillery is about 15 minutes from my home and offers free tours, which I sadly have not taken part in yet.

35% ALC by vol, 70 Proof. Around $22.99 to $24.99 for a 750ml depending on the store.
Distilled and bottled by Drum Circle Distilling, Sarasota, FL

**Nose**: There is a pleasant vanilla and fruity smell that hits you first, followed by honey and a slight amount of cinnamon.

**Taste**: Easily the smoothest rum I've tasted. If I was going to introduce a novice into sipping a drink, rather than doing a shot or making a cocktail, this would be my first choice. The vanilla and honey are the first things present, but after a second you can get of taste of orange and honey. The rum is made with 100% pure Florida sugarcane, and it shows through the sweetness. However, it is not overly sweet, but rather goes hand and hand with the spices.

**Finish**: A faint taste of banana and spice. A little pepper, maybe.

This rum has suddenly become the new big things for me and my friends. I gave a sample in flask form to a friend, who is primarily a scotch drinker, and he responded, ""Dude, this rum is the SHIT! "" And since then has bought multiple bottles for himself and friends. I urged a coworker who drinks rum exclusively to get a bottle, and now he says it's all he drinks. We have all agreed it is dangerously good because it's so tasty and smooth that you accidentally drink the bottle in one night.

If you live in Florida, you need to try this. For those outside the state, according to their website, it's available through Total Wine or online.

I thought you guys may know a little bit about Havana and Cuba, either through simply enjoying rum, or by following that enjoyment to Cuba itself. 

I had a cocktail recipe in mind, but I think it may play on traditional Cuban culture more than modern Cuban culture.  I won't ask you guys to make the cocktail of course, but could someone perhaps share some insight to modern Cuban/Havana city culture?

I also feel incredibly lucky to live in Los Angeles, where I can drive to K&amp;L and get the latest Golden Devil releases, and whatever other fantastic offerings they may have.  It's true that we don't have as many options as whisk(e)y drinkers, and we have to wait longer between interesting releases, but we are also paying a FRACTION of what whisk(e)y drinkers are paying, for the same quality product.  Anyway, it's a great time to be alive, and certainly, a great time to be a rum drinker, and I appreciate all of you in this forum.  TLDR; I'm drunk.",39,2018-01-13 16:13:37

11PoseidonsKiss20,7q7nvm,2,rum,I just tried actual good aged rum for the first time. And it is delicious.,"My premium alcohol journey began in Kentucky so naturally, I got into Bourbon. Now I live in Miami, Florida so I figured I should dabble in the Caribbean life of rum. 

On a journey to Costa Rica I had some Centenario of several ages and they were....not bad. But they didn't convert me. I've even reviewed one here a long time ago. Every year for my birthday I buy myself a new bottle of liquor, usually bourbon. However this year I decided to give rum another try. I selected **Ron de Angelo 12 a√±os** from Panama. And it. Is. Delicious. 

Don't get me wrong, I have no intention of abandoning my whisky origins but this rum was awesome. No idea where this particular rum ranks in this community. For all I know I selected piss in your eyes, but I think it's awesome. 

Since I am more familiar with bourbon my pallet is used to the dry, earthy malt flavors so perhaps the sweetness of molasses is just fresh to me. 

I'd love some other recommendations. I drink it neat and I frequently drink while smoking cigars. Cheers!",5,2018-01-14 06:12:10

plot_hole,7r1le2,2,rum,"Recommendations needed, small collection.","Hello,

I want to keep it brief. I like rum. My collection does not deserve the name, but I can tell you what I like and what I don't like. Based on that, I'd be happy if someone would like to recommend something for me to try.

What I currently drink:

Ron Zacapa XO

Botucal 2002 Single Vintage

Plantation 20

Ron Zacapa 23

Santa Teresa 1796

Don Papa

I really like the Zacapa XO. It's smooth, rich, sweet. The Zacapa 23 is nice, too. In comparison, I would always go for the XO, as I like it better.

The Botucal 2002 is probably not for beginners, I assume. I don't like it as much as I thought I would, based on the flavor profile. It's not harsh, but harsher then the Zacapa XO.

The Santa Teresa 1796, well, I find it rather harsh, with a burn. 

The Plantation 20, good stuff. 

The Don Papa, quite nice, but it smells like it was seriously drenched in Vanilla aroma, not natural. I like it nevertheless, although I find the aroma a tad too strong.


So, what I took from this sub, I ordered the Plantation Guatemala&amp;Belize. I think I prefer soft, smooth rum, and I don't mind them to be on the sweeter side. I would be happy if someone could recommend a bottle or two to try!

Thank you!",4,2018-01-17 23:12:26

ObeseMoreece,7f3com,8,rum,Rum ideas for Christmas,"So me and my brother agree to just ask what the other wants for Christmas rather than guessing.

He knows I want rum and the budget is around ¬£50.

I'm only recently getting in to this and don't have much of a collection (I keep drinking it but I have a bottle of diplomatico stashed for special occasions).

So my question is, what would you suggest for the budget? I was thinking along the lines of trying Gosling's as I always have Dark and stormies but I'm also interested in Mount Gay XO. Both of them together are just over ¬£50 but I was wondering if this subreddit had any suggestions for a very nice bottle for the whole ¬£50 that I would stash along with my diplomatico. Or would it be better to get 2 bottles that would be great for mixing drinks?

I have tried the following rums 

* Ron Zacapa 23, nice but I found it tasted quite similar to whisky 

* Single Estate Worthy Park and Consuelo, I love these but they are only sold in Duty free shops in airports so I'm limited to getting a couple of bottles only when my family go abroad

* Mount Gay eclipse, it's alright but been a while since I had

* Don Papa, this one got me in to rum, very sweet and great for Cuba Libres but I see now why people who are more serious would dislike it

* Diplomatico, I only have this one neat, it's just too good to mix

* Some cheaper stuff in dark and stormies like woods rum, appleton and OVD.",21,2017-11-24 07:21:48

bobothereal,7gjh8z,5,rum,Help a beginner choose his next rum(s?) from an unfortunately lacking selection.,"So basically I am a Rum newbie. Wanting to get by cheap I only tried Captain Morgan's white and spiced gold rums, Bacardi Oakheart and some super cheap crap thats name I couldn't bother looking out. My newest investment was a [Plantation Barbados Grande Reserve](https://www.plantationrum.com/plantation-grande-reserve) which I found quite nice both on itself and in the sense that unlike the ones mentioned earlier, I didn't instantly feel like spitting it back into the cup and drowning it with Lime and Coke. The reason I'm looking to expand into similar ""sipping"" rums is that even though I really liked a Cuba Libre with both the white and spiced Captain Morgans, I have zero interest in keeping my fridge stocked with Coke and Limes and the ungodly amount of ice I was freezing. 

So finally to the reason I'm posting here! I doubt anybody here is familiar with the clusterfuck of buying alcohol in Finland but TLDR; It costs a fortune to buy. Ordering from other countries, especially outside EU has regulations I have lost track of so I'm going to try grab something affordable from Estonia. 

I have been looking at the ""beginner rum"" threads and googling around but too often the price range given is very high or the price difference is just huge compared to what its like here. [Heres a link that lists the rums they're selling at the store im going to.](https://viinarannasta.ee/articlesr.php?lang=en&amp;currency=eur&amp;sid=9&amp;gid=5) I would prefer to stay near the price of the Plantation Barbados Grande Reserve (25‚Ç¨ 70cl) in order to bring in more than one or two bottles home but I'm open to suggestions. There are some glaring omissions like the often mentioned Kraken which I found on the cruise ships selection, if anybody wants to take a look at it [heres a link](https://www.sales.vikingline.com/aboard/taxfree-shopping/shopping--viking-xprs/strong-alcohol/) but you have to apply the filter yourself.

tvraisedme,7gumnr,16,rum,"""A word on plates"" - FB post from foursquare","&gt;A WORD ON PLATES

&gt;Plates (trays) are used in distillation and their function is to enhance the mixing of liquid and vapour. While their function is the same in both batch and continuous distillation, their purpose is very different.

&gt;I have observed that several people unaware that they have only a rudimentary knowledge of distillation confuse this very important distinction between the use of plates in batch (aka pot) distillation v continuous (aka column) distillation. I will try to bring a little clarity.

&gt;Basic batch distillation does not employ plates. However, it is important to understand that the lyne arm is a basic type of plate. The cooling of the atmosphere causes liquid i.e. reflux to form on the sides of the lyne arm and that mixes with the rising vapour. The lyne arm then becomes the most vital part of the batch system and its shape affects its function as a plate which directly affects the performance of a still.

&gt;In batch (pot) distillation the wine is distilled till all the alcoholic spirit is removed in as the name implies, a batch process. Our lyne arm, our ‚Äúplate‚Äù affects the level of reflux (the cooled liquid on the sides) which in turn affects two fundamental things: the timing of the arrival of the various components of the wine and the contact time with copper. The nature of our rum will be decided by the cuts. But affecting the timing of the components will affect quality of the cuts. In simple terms having a good lyne arm developing good reflux will help ensure ALL of the undesirable heads arrive early and ALL of the undesirable tails arrive late so we can made our ideal cuts. Poor reflux = poor separation by timing = poor quality heart. Low contact time with copper = poor quality heart

&gt;When we add plates to a batch (pot) system we are basically ‚Äúsupercharging‚Äù our lyne arm. If we add a condenser we are supercharging our lyne arm even further. We are using additional cooling over and above what the atmosphere gives and this together with the additional surface (the plates) will improve reflux. It is the equivalent of using a giant lyne arm.

&gt;The plates don't remove any congeners. They don't ""purify"" anything. They don't make a ""lighter rum"". The plates just affect the timing and contact time. Our cuts determine the congener profile but the plates by controlling the timing give us far greater control over what we ‚Äúselect‚Äù with our cuts. Copper is thought to play a role in ester formation so enhanced time will increase congeners. The cuts, the copper contact (and fermentation) determine how ""heavy"" we make the rum. Not the plates.

&gt;Our double retort still at Foursquare has plates above the pot and a cooling condenser. The retorts also function as a kind of plate. See the picture. Many Caribbean pot stills were modified in the 19th century to add plates.

&gt;Now in continuous distillation plates likewise enhance liquid/vapour contact. The same way you have batch distillation without plates, you could in theory build a continuous column system without plates. But it would be impractically tall. The enhanced liquid/vapour contact (with external condenser cooling) make the continuous column system practical. And with enough plates and reflux we can separate pure ethanol (but we are talking over 75 plates in the last column alone) from the other congeners. In a steady state continuous column system the plates enhance the physical separation in the column and we draw off heads and tails from physical points where these congeners are concentrated. We also draw ethanol (or light spirit) from the physical point where the ethanol is positioned in the column. So the net effect of plates is to assist in ‚Äúpurification‚Äù or making lighter spirits or indeed making pure alcohol.

&gt;So plates have very different roles depending on whether it is continuous or batch distillation. The function is the same, the role is different.

&gt;And while on the topic, there are no hybrid stills. Still are either batch or continuous. With or without plates.

&gt;Avoid sounding stupid, know the difference.

Zodsayskneel,7jex6w,2,rum,Looking for Rum Recommendations for Ambiguous Punch Recipe.,"Looking for inexpensive (but not *cheap*) recommendations for this punch recipe I found:


* 2 1/2 cups pineapple juice
* 2 1/2 cups orange juice
* 1 cup rum
* 1/2 cup dark rum
* 1/4 cup coconut rum
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
* 3 tablespoons grenadine syrup

The only rum I'm set on using is Cruzan for the coconut rum since I can get it for $10 and I'm sure it's worlds better than Malibu. I might just use Cruzan Aged Dark for the dark rum as well (I already have a bottle of Gosling's I rarely touch. Use that instead?). 

But what style would you use for the ingredient that just says ""rum"" since it's the main alcohol component? I was thinking of using Don Q Anejo but thought that might be a little dry. Mount Gay Eclipse? El Dorado 5 year?",3,2017-12-13 07:25:28

TieDyeSky,7k648l,4,rum,"What are your favorite bottom, middle, and top shelf rums?","My weekend drink of choice is usually rum and coke, but I cant really afford to spend $30 on a bottle of nice stuff every week, so I tend to separate my rums into three tiers.

Bottom shelf: Less than $20 for a handle (1.75l)

*  Lady Bligh. It is similar to captain, but a little bit smoother and cheaper. Works well with coke and a little lime, and is only $17 for a handle. 

Mid tier:

* Mount gay eclipse. The normal eclipse is by far the best value spiced rum at around $16 for a 750ml. It tastes almost identical to cuban Havana Club A√±ejo Especial, and is good enough neat, and incredible with coke. 
* Mount Gay silver. This is used almost exclusivly for a classic cuba libre or a daiquiri. Only $14 for 750ml and worlds better than bacardi.

Top Shelf (sort of) :  

* Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva. At about $40 a bottle, This is the most expensive rum I always have on hand. It has a great smokey oak that cuts through the sweet caramel, and is all around a fantastic sipper.
*  El Dorado 12y. Cheaper and sweeter than the Diplimatico, I drink this when I am in the mood for a vanilla bomb. Still excellent, and at $30, a very good value. 
* Plantation Pineapple. I usually hate flavored rums, but plantation pineapple has a fantastic natural pineapple flavor that perfectly compliments subtle molasses and vanilla flavors. Good for sipping or for cocktails, it is worth the $30 I pay for it.  


I have tried more expensive rums, but none of them have wowed me to the point that I need to have them on hand. I would say that I drink each of these at least once a month, and will usually offer something from the upper 2 tiers to guests who like rum.

 So what are your choices in these categories?

The reality of a $14 bottle that is at least four years old, 100 proof and bottled under ""lock and key"" appeals to my inner cheap skate. 

I started paying attention to cheap rum when a Cuban BYOB appeared in the neighborhood.  Ron Matusalem Plantino's ""Taste of Cuba"" pitch and $18 price hooked me. A few years later Faber spirits appeared on the shelves of the Philadelphia LCB shops.  Faber talks up the made in Pennsylvania but when asked they admitted offline that they don't distill anything. Faber only bottle their rum. Faber does boast of filtering their Vodka and using half the added sugar of most flavored vodka. That said, $13 got you a tasty clear rum with no nonsense packaging.  Then I was spoiled by $12 Havana Club from the corner stores all over Spain. From there it was Flor De Cana 4, Barbancourt clear, Wray and Nephew and most recently Real McCoy 3 year.  

While I respect the history behind the Real McCoy, the real story is 4 Square. As you probably know 4 Square leads to Doorly's 5. I'm just amazed at the quality of a $12 bottle of rum.  I love the transparency on aging, and the lack of artificial coloring, flavors, sweeteners or sugar.  

How this stuff isn't the talk of the town, I don't know but I know what I'll be making daiquiris and such with. ",9,2017-09-27 03:33:46

English-joe,6w8one,6,rum,Rum Classification - Better ways than color? Why not Region?,"I'm a bartender, and I am trying to research and write up rum classifications for future training. However, I hate the color system. It doesn't do much to explain a rum, or even provide a clue as to it's taste (along with BS additives etc). (I learn best by learning how something is made, and how those flavors got there). However, google searches, popular blogs and even books all go by color, it seems. 

I've also read the whiskey exchange's blog on the new Gargano  system, but I'm not a fan of that either. 

Although it might be hard, why can we not agree to just classify by region, like whiskey? Islands (and the main land regions) all tend to do things there own way, or in the style of another which could be grouped together. E.G  a funky Jamaican style typically using pot stills, or the industrial style cuban/Puerto Rico producing light bodied rums. If a rum deviates form it's locale's style, (or for the newer US based rums), you could even label it as ""Cuban style"". ",15,2017-08-27 06:48:59

MJBPDX,6zsku7,6,rum,Review: Plantation 20th Anniversary,"**Stats**
Alc./Vol. : 40%
Origin : Barbados
Raw material : Molasses
Fermentation : 3 to 5 days
Distillation : Pot Still &amp; column
Tropical ageing : 8 to 10 years the rums used for XO are chosen for their structure with aromatic characteristics suited for intensive oak aging
Continental ageing, elevage : 2 to 10 years. This is a sophisticated blend of very old rums from Barbados that are finished in many different type of casks ranging from new white oak to bourbon cask as well as Cognac Casks each with different level of toasting.

**Rating** - **90** for cigar smokers. **83** for everyone else.

**Thoughts**

This might be one of the most love/hate rums. You can find every take on the spectrum here and on the review sites, with a couple of them toeing a careful 'don't stop sending me samples' line. If you don't like Plantation Stiggins or sweetened rums, you are unlikely to dig the unrelenting baking spice/molasses notes and hopeful promise of a finish (cut short in its prime by the low proof), but hold up. I have two potential solutions that can bring this one up to a higher score:

1. Cigars. If you smoke them, this rum shines as a counterpoint to a really spicy tobacco. In fact, this was my favorite spirit to pair with cigars this summer. I assume they have this in mind, since they put cigar pairings right on the dang Plantation website.

2. OFTD. The Plantation Old Fashioned Traditional Dark. (I'm saying that in the Sam L Jackson ""The AK FORTY SEVEN"" voice, if you're wondering). Put a splash of this 69% beast in the 20th Anniversary. The finish shows a promise of bright cognac notes in the normal proof, then dies an unseemly early death in baking spice and fruitcake. A bit more proof from the dark rum and that opens up quite a bit, and adds a complex cognac note throughout the whole experience.

I really like the higher proof Plantation single casks, and I think there's a good chance for them to hit the $40-$50 mark on a nice finished higher proof product in this line. For the moment, it's still worth the money (at $40-$45) for cigars and with a little help from an overproof dark rum.

69Tears,70ifgj,11,rum,Two intermediate/beginner rum style questions,"I've been trying to improve my rum knowledge in order to decide on what styles would be most useful to keep in my drinks cabinet for cocktails. I've been reading the Smugglers Cove book and Rum Revolution by Tristan Stephenson, both of which are excellent, but have left me with a couple of questions:

1) Black rum vs dark aged rum. Firstly, I understand the difference between the two, that's not my question. My question is, how can I tell the difference when buying? It seems sellers, both online or shops don't distinguish between the two, and even the manufacturers can be a bit opaque about it. How do I know what I'm buying if it's not something I've tried before?

2) What's the benefit of a column stilled rum over a blended. In the cocktails in the Smuggler's Cove book  Column-still aged is the most used style after blended aged, then blended lightly aged. I can understand that blended might have its benefits over a pot-still which might overpower in a cocktail, but then would using a column-still not just make it less... rum-my? I guess what I'm asking is, what am I missing out on if I use a blended rum instead of a column-stilled one?

I understand that I could probably work all this out by trying more rums, but I can't afford all the bottles I want!",11,2017-09-17 02:15:49

TheAvarageNerd,6px9b1,6,rum,My experience with rum (or: A beginners brabbling about rum punch),"Note: This post has no real point, except for asking for opinions about what to try next, maybe?

Anyway, here's my story:  
I dislike the taste of alcohol (and basically all alcoholic beverages). This stuff just stinks, and I can't stand it. No matter if beer, wine or anything, I can't drink it.  
It's for this reason, that I've never been drunk until late after my 19th birthday (which means quite something in this day and age).

Now, here in Switzerland we have a drink called ""Rumpunsch"", which does not contain alcohol (or even real rum). It's just a sirup with artificial flavours, that get's poured into hot water. It's usually sold during the skiing season in the mountain huts. And that's a drink I curiously love.

I love cooking, and for that reason I have bottles of liquor at my expense, one of them being a strong, cheap rum. During a new years eve party at a friends home, I decided to try and make this ""Rumpunsch"" in real. So I mixed black tea with lemon and loads of sugar, and then poured some rum into it.  
Of course the water was still pretty hot and I didn't dare to put too much rum into it, but whatever I created there had a good taste.

From this moment on I started experimenting around with it. Each time I got invited somewhere, I decided to bring a bottle of this drink with me, which was slightly different from before. At the beginning there were giant amounts of sugar inside to suppress the taste of the alcohol, but it's a little bit less by now. 

I started experimenting with different teas and ways to sweeten it, and then gave it to my friends to try it. Half of them stated the it was much to sweet to be drinkable, while the other half claimed that it was the best drink with rum that they ever had (by now they want me to make it whenever I'm invited).  
It also turns out to be quite a dangerous drink, as usually the taste of alcohol is really weak, while it has the alcohol percentage of wine. Great for student parties.

I've since started to drink rum pure, and it's the only liquor I can drink. And while I really enjoy the taste nuances of it, I do need about half an hour for a serving of about 3 cl. just because of the strong alcohol.  
Oh, and I've also tried basically every cocktail with rum I could find, a came to the conclusion that a Mojito is pretty comparable to my drink in sweetness and strength of alcoho, but a lot more annoying to prepare. 

So, for anybody interested at this point, here's my favourite receipes and the question: Do these drinks have a name? And what should I try next?

3/4 liters of water  
100-200 gr of brown sugar  
Juice of one large lemon  
Boil it. Turn off stove.  
2 bags of black tea (not necessary, but I like it)  
Put them in the hot water and wait until it's gotten to a drinkable temperature.
2.5 dl of dark rum (not captain morgan though... that's the only thing that managed to ruin this drink)  
Enjoy. In my experience it's best not to cool it, but to drink it above room temperature.

Alernatively, exchange black tea, sugar and lemon through 250 gr of honey.

So that's it. My way to say hello to the community where I'll probably be reading quite a bit in the upcoming days.",6,2017-07-28 00:53:30

texacer,6typ70,9,rum,Proofing Down,"sup Pirates. 

I mentioned a while back I recently discovered I really enjoy some overproofed Rums.  Nearly as much as Cask Strength Whisky, maybe even more depending on the brands of course.

The only problem is, overproofed Rums are all over 70% alcohol and I want to live.  

Rum has this issue where its seems to be either 40-42% alcohol or 69-75%.  My sweetspot is usually around the 1hundred-teens proof.

So wat do?

proof down.  

First attempt:  1:1 blend of Plantation Dark and OFTD.  if I get the portions right it sits around 113 proof and damn is it good.  

I can drink it neat at 73%abv but not a lot of it.  Blending the two seems to have worked wonderful.  

Now what to try next?  I grabbed a Don Q 151.  If i enjoy it, i'll grab a regular 40% and do the same.  

why not just add water?  shut up thats why.

Acrimony01,6ln41b,11,rum,The 15 Bottle Sugarcane Collection,"Hello /r/rum

I got really sick of wine and beer over the last decade (they're great, just had my fill) and I've moved on to spirits, which I enjoy far more.

This subreddit has been very helpful in allowing me to learn about Rum, which I knew nothing about really. 

I've limited myself to only 15 slots for rum. That's all I have space for (for now). I started with 5, but realized how preposterous that was with the diversity of the booze. It's not that I'll never go over 15, but I'd like to keep it around there for practicability sakes. For reference my collection will include 15 whiskies, 15 vodkas/gins/flavored spirits, 5 Agave based drinks, 5 brandies and 5 ""others"". 30 cordials, 10 Amaro and 5 fortified wines. Add to those half dozen bitters, various mixers, and almost every type of sweetener and citrus available.

My mission is to get 15 sugarcane based liquors that:

* Have the greatest diversity of flavor and style
* Cover all or most of the styles out there
* Avoid redundancy
* Allow for different drinking styles (neat, cocktails)
* Allow for different budget concerns (high-end stuff, everyday drinkers)
* Present a wide geographic representation
* Adhere to established classifications (Cate, mostly)
* Allow me to have the most possible drinks/variations
* Are good!

So without further ado‚Ä¶here are 15 rums that I chose and why:

**YOUNG**

* Cacha√ßa

Novo Fogo Unaged or Aged ‚Äì I had a lot of trouble with this category. I found it redundant with Blanc Agricole, and considered replacing it with unaged Rum like Wray &amp; Nephew or Pritchard‚Äôs Crystal. It‚Äôs really a supply issue here. I can‚Äôt find them very well. This one from Total Wine seems fine though, and has a pretty good reputation for an imported Cachaca meant for the American market. 

* Blanc Agricole

Neisson Rhum BA ‚Äì Seems like a standard for the Ti‚Äô Punch. Seems to have the best reputation for Blanc Agricole. 

* Column Still Lightly Aged

Don Q Cristal ‚Äì Good ol‚Äô Don Q. This is strange rum, almost being vodka like. I found it fit the style of Spanish Rums well though. Clean and light, it‚Äôs been great in mojitos and daiquiris. I think I‚Äôll stick with it. 

* Blended Lightly Aged

Plantation 3 Star - This rum had such good reviews and reputation it was hard to ignore. I was tempted to put Banks 5 or 7 here, but I wanted an offering from Plantation. It‚Äôs a great all around mixer. Can‚Äôt believe total wine doesn‚Äôt have it. Sad!  

* Pot Still Lightly Aged

Smith &amp; Cross - This was the second Rum I bought. I was completely blown away. I smelled it and said ‚Äúwhat the fuck?!‚Äù It‚Äôs powerful and funky. This seems like exactly what Jamaican rum should be. I use it to punch up cocktails. 

**AGED**

* Vieux Agricole

Clement VSOP - A standard aged Agricola in the traditional fashion. Good enough to have neat but OK to mix too. I haven‚Äôt bought this yet, but it seems promising. 

* Column Still Aged

Bacardi 8 ‚Äì As a non-rum drinker, I still knew Bacardi was shit. The only person I know who drinks this swill is my scumbag father-in-law. Not surprised about that. However, I was surprised by the reviews and price of this offering from Bacardi. If it sucks, I‚Äôll go to Don Q Gran Anejo, but I love the value here. 

* Pot Still Aged

Hamilton St. Lucia Pot Still ‚Äì I had the most trouble with this category. I also had trouble figuring out who the hell made Hamilton. I had to order this online. It‚Äôs on the way. The reputation on this was great. 

* Blended Bajan

Doorly‚Äôs 12 ‚Äì It was cheap, available at Total Wine, and comparable to the more expensive Barbadian rums.  Seems like a great value. Haven‚Äôt tried it yet. 

* Blended Sweet

Diplomatico Rum Reserva Exclusiva ‚Äì This category is a monster. El Dorado, Zacapa. There are a lot of choices and I can see why. I may not hold this one rum above all here, and freely admit that I‚Äôm probably going to switch this around. Diplomatico has great reviews and rep. It‚Äôs where people are told to start. I get that. So I‚Äôll have a go at it.

**EXOTIC**

* Pot Still Black (well, blended pot stills)

Myers ‚Äì Some of you may cringe at this. I certainly did. Myers holds a special place in my heart though. I had parents that rarely drank. But high up, in a mysterious cabinet, was a bottle of this. It was almost solely reserved for pineapple upside-down cake. It was the first rum I tried. Strangely enough, my fianc√© loves this stuff, as she had a similar experience. Tastes fine in a D&amp;S. Adds some color. It‚Äôs not complex, but it‚Äôs cheap and fun. If I grow out of this I‚Äôll probably try any of the dark rums on the market like Coruba, Goslings or Hamilton 86.

* Navy Blended Black

Wood‚Äôs 100 Navy ‚Äì Another category I had issues with. I wasn‚Äôt even sure this WAS a category. A couple of things made me choose this though. There was a lot of chatter that it was very authentic for the ‚Äúdaily tot‚Äù which I found kind of historically appealing. It was a blend from a couple countries, with over proofing. 

* Black Overproof

Lemon Hart 151 ‚Äì I had read conflicting reports of this. It‚Äôs not available, it‚Äôs available. Its changed etc‚Ä¶ Well I‚Äôm kind of late to the game, but that‚Äôs OK. I flipped a coin between Plantation OFTD and this. This won. It‚Äôs really good. Adds serious power to some of the tiki drinks I‚Äôve made. The plantation is probably great too. 

* Flavored

Plantation Stiggins Pineapple ‚Äì Recommended to me by /u/GratefulDawg 73. Very cool stuff. I liked the idea that flavored rum could be good. Flavored liquor gets a bad rap. I can see why. Yeah, I‚Äôve puked up Malibu. Yeah it‚Äôs one of my worst memories as a human being. This is great though. Awesome in a Hawaiian cocktail

 * Spiced

Bayou Spiced ‚Äì When discussing rums with my fianc√©, one of her first questions was ‚ÄúWhat about Captain Morgan?‚Äù The last time I drank Captain Morgan was drinking Tattoo playing triangle bullshit. I became‚Ä¶intoxicated and remember falling asleep with a particularly disgusting film on the inside of my mouth. Everything I had learned up until this point said ‚ÄúNo, fuck that‚Äù. But she made a good point. This bar wasn‚Äôt just for me. It was for guests too. Some people like Captain Morgan. Some people like Kraken. That‚Äôs OK. Hell, this is the beauty of rum. Someone took rum and added spices. So what? El Dorado and Zacapa dump sugar in there rum. What‚Äôs wrong with spices? So I compromised and found this stuff. She‚Äôs from Louisiana, and its American made. I loved it. I made it with red beans and rice. 

**AVOIDING**

* Unaged Rums

Why no unaged rum? Well they just seem kind of redundant. I was puzzled by Cate‚Äôs mention of them. They‚Äôre almost all American made. I just can‚Äôt really find a use for them. 

* Long-Aged Rums

I‚Äôm simply too much of a novice for this category. Maybe after I learn what I really like in a couple of years, I‚Äôll try one of these. But they are simply not worth it right now. I can‚Äôt appreciate them.

* Other Agricoles

The main reason I upgraded from 10 to 15 rums was because of Agricole. I‚Äôm still learning about it. Perhaps I‚Äôll end up liking it better than rum. Who knows?  Of course fucking St. George makes one too. I‚Äôm sticking with the basics for now. 

* Appleton

I looked over my list, and there is a glaring omission of Appleton here. Some people would probably find that heretical. I agree. Appleton 12 works as a Blended Aged. Appleton Estate works as a Blended Lightly Aged. But frankly, I found more interesting stuff to put in those spots. I‚Äôm not going to rule it out. It‚Äôs probably great rum. It just really didn‚Äôt fit anywhere to me. 

* Zacapa/Zaya/El Dorado/Flor De Cana

I found these Rums falling into the Blended Aged Sweet category, which was pretty massive. Again, I think I‚Äôll rotate them around to find which one I like. A lot of you would argue that I should throw out other categories for more of these. That makes sense, but I want the variety in lightly aged and black rums. I‚Äôll try these someday, after I polish off the bottle of Diplomatico. 

Any comments or critiques please! What am I missing? Is there redundancy? What should I add if I went to 20 bottles?

I'm currently organizing the bar situation for my upcoming wedding and I need a little help in the Rum department.  We're going with a full bar setup.  I've got most of the liquors/cocktails covered with the exception of Rum.  

I've never been a huge drinker of Rum.  I had some experience with Bacardi, Captain Morgan, and Admiral Nelson back in college but that's about the extent of it.  

So, I need to figure out what Rums I need to buy and some example of drinks that we can make with them.  We won't have anything frozen, so daiquiris and whatnot are out.  

As far as price goes, I'd like to keep it under $20/bottle but I'm willing to spend more if it's worth the price.  The Mescal I picked out is $37/bottle but anything cheaper than that just isn't good.  If a good Rum can't be had for $20 then I'm fine going over. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

your99problems,6nx0rw,3,rum,Review #1 Black Label,"Hello all, 

A few days ago I asked this sub why I have not seen this bottle talked about too much here. The simple answer I got was they do not export this rum outside of Trinidad so not too many people have access to it. So I figured for my first review will be unique! 

I got this bottle from one of my friends whose dad went to Trinidad and brought me this bottle back! 

Lets get started with the review

43% abv, rested in the glass for 15 minutes and drank neat. 

Nose: Lemon, Vanilla, bit of alcohol, but not to strong to put me off this rum. As it gets more air I start smelling strawberries, melon, pineapple, green apple, sweet and sour notes. 

Palate: Lemon, smokey, pineapple, sweet that transitions to sour, very small hints of oak wood, apple peal. The alcohol scent disappears and becomes excellent to sip on. 

Finish: Short, smokey, apples, wood, vanilla. 

Rating: A

Rating Scale: 
            A+ = Best rum that I have ever had
            A = Excellent rum that I will have only on special occasion
            B = Very good, will have this often with good company
            C = Good, daily sipper / will order at the bar if they have 
            D = Will only drink this if it is the only thing available 
            F = Will not drink or give to my worst enemy

The worst part of this rum is knowing, I cannot get it whenever I want. It is excellent quality, and always nice to have on a special occasion. Also having this bottle will be nice for show in the collection as a talking piece (even give a small sample if I like the person). I hope my first review was good! ",4,2017-07-18 07:45:00

Tarquin_Underspoon,6oc4xn,8,rum,Don't care for most of the rums I've tried. Love Stiggins. What to buy next?,"Hey there, rum people! I've been lurking on this sub for a month or so and decided to jump in.

I'm mostly a bourbon and Scotch drinker, but I've tried my fair share of rums. However, most of the ones that I've tried have not agreed with my tastebuds. Off the top of my head, I've sampled, in recent memory: Barbancourt 15, Flor de Cana 7, Havana Club 7, Abuelo 7, and Bacardi 8. All of them have tasted thin, sugary and spirity to me.

Then, a couple of months ago, I picked up a bottle of Plantation Stiggins, and I can't get enough of the stuff. It's rich, not too sweet, and not spirity in the way that the other rums I've tried have been.

So, where do I go from here? From the list above, you can guess that I've mostly tried Spanish-style rums so far. Should I branch out to Appleton or Smith &amp; Cross? Or maybe a navy-style like Pussers? I'm no stranger to funky flavors in my spirits - Laphroaig 10 CS is one of my favorite whiskies - so the ""funky"" descriptors sound kind of appealing. 

Thanks, y'all!",13,2017-07-20 06:45:18

I'm looking to spend $20-30 on my second sipping rum ever. I've been using white rum in mixed drinks for a while but I really like sipping what I have now. 

I'm not a fan of too much smokeyness that sometimes you get in bourbon and scotch so this seems like a better option

I'm located in Maryland, right outside of D.C.

I have plantation 5 year Barbados and I love it 

I'm looking for something maybe a little richer in flavor but also smooth and have been considering cruzan single Barrel, el dorado 8, and diplomatico reserva, which are all available for less the $25 a bottle

Is there anything else I should look into getting in that price range? And what is everyone's opinion of those three choices? 


EDIT: I just found that I can get R.L Seale 10 in that range and appleton 12 and el dorado 12 for about $30 each

A close friend introduced me to Smith &amp; Cross several weeks ago however, and I have been firmly hooked by it. Enough to have gone through a bottle it, and make a few other purchases as well.

I'm looking for some direction on rum purchases based on the following:

* Love peaty/smoky scotch and cask strength Whisky... think Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Aberlour A'bunadh

* Love bitter and funky apertivo and amari - think Dell'Erborista, Fernet Branca, Campari, Cynar Chartreuse, Malort.

* Love other high ABV/cask strength whiskey as well... BiB Bourbons like Old Grand-Dad, Henry McKenna, also things like good old Wild Turkey 101, Rittenhouse Rye

Have tried the following rums and enjoyed them a great deal... Smith &amp; Cross (favorite so far) Appleton Estate Reserve, and Rhum Babancourt 8-year. Also have Zacapa 23-year Solera and although I appreciate its depth, it is getting close to the ""too sweet"" mark for me.

I generally enjoy spirits neat, or in cocktails, but have not gotten into tiki... again, thinking it will all be too sweet. Not a fan of tons of fruit juice and sugar with my booze.

TLDR: Don't like super sweet. Still want to explore rum. Any suggestions?

ArtDSellers,6hfvj7,21,rum,Mystery shady rum riddle solved.,"Having grown tired of the riddle game that /u/WyHamRob was playing, I looked through the comments to put an end to this dumb conversation.

So, he can't tell us what label this is, cuz he might get sued or something, or whatever.  But, he did leave us a rather obvious bread crumb, repeatedly saying ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""  I initially read this as him just saying that the mysterious company was getting its comeuppance.  But, it seems he was tipping his hand, without actually saying the name ""Hemingway.""  Apparently that gives him some plausible deniability when the boogie man comes after him, cuz maybe he just like to randomly state the name of Hemingway novels with no context (other than to expose the name of the label he can't expose...).

Anyway.  It seems to be Hemingway, maker of Papa's Pilar, that he's referring to.  A COLA search on TTB's database indicates that its label approval has been surrendered, as of mid-May 2017 (at least I think that's what the designation means).  As to why that has occurred, I can only speculate, but given the narrative by /u/WyHamRob it would seem that perhaps they got caught lying about their aging process.  Who knows...?  In any event, their label approval has been surrendered.

[Just search ""Papa's Pilar"" in the ""Product Name"" field.](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/publicSearchColasAdvanced.do)

Zarcton,6i23sf,6,rum,What to try next?,"Hello everyone! 

I am fairly new to rum. This is very exciting for me as I am not a person who like whiskey or any other avec styled spirits. But when I found rum I could finally relate to people who drink whiskey or cognac for example. 

I am still trying to work out the style of rum I like the most and I came here looking for suggestions. 

As it is right now a few of the rums I do like are Millonario 15 and XO, Plantation XO, Ron Esclavo XO, Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, Ron quorum XO. 

From what I gather these rums are considered rather sweet and have a taste profile heavily infused with vanilla and fudge / caramel. So I guess I am looking for similar types of rum to broaden my horizon even more of this amazing beverage. ",12,2017-06-19 05:17:06

I thought they were great, particularly the ginger. So as someone who has also really enjoyed Plantation's Pineapple, I was thinking of having a go myself this summer.

Most guides with maceration pertain to adding the alcohol flavour to the fruit/food, rather than the other way round.

The plan was;

* Use a semi decent White Rum (UK available, it'll probably be Appleton White/Havana 3 Anos, maybe Plantation 3 Stars).

* Roughly 1/5-1/4 fill a Kilner Jar with the flavouring (Ginger or Pinapple want to try first).

* Top up with rum, add some sugar? This is the bit I'm unsure about - The Box Bar's ones did not particularly taste like they added sugar.

* Leave for 2-3 Months, sealed. When it's ready, filter back into the bottle.

Does that sound about right? Anybody have any tips?",2,2017-04-28 18:46:49

anax44,6c0oku,4,rum,Malibu and Plantation,"I recently paid attention to some recent mentions of Malibu in a rum discussion space;

 - Someone responded to the [When is a rum not a rum](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/698rs2/when_is_a_rum_not_a_rum/) lecture from Tales of the cocktails by saying ""when it's not Malibu"" although not a single person in the video even mentioned Malibu. 

 - Another time, someone did a review of Malibu and while most people were cool about it, others were really hostile towards him.

 - Finally, someone made a joke about rums that aren't rums and they listed  AR√îME, Doc Brown's Really Bad Rum, Stoneyard Colorado Rum, Malibu and a few others.

That last one got me thinking, because if I ever purchased any of those fake rums I would feel like I was ripped off and lied to, but I don't feel that way about Malibu.; I know fully well that it's cheap rum with coconut flavoring and sweetener. Almost everyone knows that!

Malibu drinkers should be given a list of cocktails with coconut to try instead of being told that Malibu is not real rum.

Also, Malibu is honest; the bottle says that's it's ""Caribbean Rum with Coconut Liqueur"". 

I respect that more than so many other ""rums"" that have almost as much sugar as Malibu but pretend to be pure rum.

I'm sure that if there was a really good coconut rum released as ""Malibu XO"" everyone will say it's crap, but if it's released as ""Plantation Coconut Stiggins"", those same people will love it!

Plantation is a really cool brand of rum and I would recommend it to any friends getting into rum since there are so many varieties.

Personally though, I find that they commit so many rum sins that people just ignore;

 - The added sugar. Few companies in the industry add as much sugar as Plantation!

 - Numbers on labels. 20th Anniversary is an assemblage of fine rums 12 - 20 years old. Three Star is not three years old. Numbers should not be on a label if it's not an age statement. They're just like Zaya and Flor De Cana in this regard.

 - What Plantation? I know for a fact that their stuff from Trinidad does not come from a plantation. I find that using names and imagery associated with rum and the Caribbean like plantations, mermaids, sea monsters etc is just tacky!",7,2017-05-19 09:40:39

I'm here to ask you for some recommendations on what rum to choose next.

Here's some info: I'm a beer and whisky drinker. I frequently enjoy  scotch whiskies, especially peated ones. My favourite from what I bought so far is Ardbeg Uigeadail. I read about rum online and here in the sidebar and decided to try some of the good stuff, instead of Bacardi-type... things. So I got Zacapa Centenario 23 and found it to be very delicious with an amazing deep aroma. The only problem I might have with it is the prolongued sweetness.

So now I'm looking to pick my second bottle of rum, something similar to Zacapa maybe. I know Plantation 20TH Anniversary might be a good choice, or maybe Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, but what do you think?

Budget: up to 60-70 dollars. Looking for good value for money.

PaulWog,61vye1,16,rum,"""Real Rum vs. Sugar-Added Rum"" - Where do you draw the line?","I love rum.

For the purposes of this thread, I am *only* looking at aged (golden/dark) rum.

What I am wondering is... are you really a true fan of rum, if all you like is super sugary rums? I'm talking reserva exclusiva, el dorado 12, zaya. Those things have so much sugar in them, and so much flavor added, that they blur the gap between rum... and spiced rum. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy some spiced rums. And I love El Dorado and Zaya (and I haven't tried any diplomatico rums yet). But, I see many rum collectors/aficionados who swear by almost exclusively the sugary stuff. It's ""smoother"", they say. I'll tell you, if I took my Mount Gay XO and dumped 26g/L of sugar into it, it would damn well taste smoother too!! (Although that would throw the flavour profile off most likely).

To me, a sugary rum is interesting, but feels like a cheat. When I try Zaya or El Dorado, I feel like I'm drinking 50% rum, and 50% spiced rum. Something that sits in the middle. When I drink Mount Gay XO, or Flor De Cana 18-Year, I feel like all the flavours I'm getting are legitimate rum flavours; no trickery, no spiced gimmicks, every bit of the experience relies on masterful techniques that require ~0 sugar (practically) in the bottle.

When I hear someone say something like: ""I love rum, but I can't stand dry-rum1, dry-rum2, and dry-rum3. But I love sugary-rum1, sugary-rum2, sugary-rum3.""... well, I cringe a bit. And I see it a lot here. Someone asks for a smooth rum, and they are met with ""try this sugary one!"", rather than a suggestion of a smooth rum that is smooth because of the actual ageing process (Flor De Cana 18 is an EXCELLENT example of smooth).

In the end, spiced rum, proper dry rum, rum that sits between dry and sugary, and sugary rum... all of those can be excellent. I love collecting and trying it all (less-so spiced rums but every once in a while). But to see a rum-focused reddit section with so much heavy focus on sugary rums, I don't know, I had to make a post about that.

On a side-note: Every time I mention mixing a really nice rum in coke (about 1:2 to 1:4 ratio), I am met with a lot of negativity. Yet, the same people love their sugared rums. I don't get it. They say ""you can't taste an expensive rum in coke"". I say, if you can't tell the difference in the quality of a rum through your coke, you must be drinking a 1:8 ratio, or you really don't know your rum (and yes, some great rums don't do well in coke). But I don't get how people will say ""THIS RUM IS AMAZING"" (so much sugar in it), and ""Never mix it with coke! that's a waste"". Blah. Bugs me.

**By one definition of sugary rum with ""added flavors"", then rum + bitters + water + sugar = rum. It's not a mixed drink, it's just rum. Right? ... Come on!**",72,2017-03-28 08:03:25

LordMoe,62uwko,12,rum,Anything known about the kind of rum that colonial Americans drank?,"Cross post from /r/history

Much has been written about the beer, whiskey, cider, and wine consumed by the colonial Americans. It is widely known that the Americans also drank a lot of rum. The question is, though, what was the rum like?
Rye whiskey was very popular in America, particularly in Pennsylvania. Washington enjoyed a good glass of Porter style beer and of course loved his cider and apparently could hold his booze really well. Jefferson took a loving to French wine and even attempted to import grapes to Monticello, but they did not do well in the Virginia climate and soil.
All of these are of course easy to find today. But what kind of rum did they drink? What would the modern equivalent to the type of rum they drank be? Was it the dark rum like Myers makes in Jamaica? The white rum of Cuba and Puerto Rico? The aged rums of Trinidad, Barbados, and Jamaica today? Golden rum like Mount Gay? Or maybe it was spiced like Sailor Jerry's for all I know! Has much been written of the rum?",7,2017-04-02 03:31:05

cwipnip,64y22w,10,rum,Hopped Rum,"So I've been experimenting with hopping a few spirits, my favourite so far is in Rum. It's absolutely delicious and I'd thought I'd share my experience.

Firstly hops- I've been using citra hop pellets from my local home brew store.

Secondly Rum- I've tried it with Brugal Anejo and Woods navy strength.

I've been hopping at a ratio of about 20g hop/litre into a muslin bag and infusing it for 1 hour. I then pass it through a coffee filter to remove any small particulates.

The Brugal is awesome, best served with ginger ale, your getting tropical fruit, citrus and mango flavours coming through from the hops on top of the rum.

Woods navy strength tho, I warn you against using an overproof rum as far to much of the alpha acid from the hops goes into solution and when placed with a mixer goes really milky in apperance and horrendously bitter.

In summary, try making a hopped rum, but don't use an overproof or you'll get a quick lesson in chemistry.",25,2017-04-12 21:14:11

FrankMercer,5ytvj7,3,rum,Best Use for Appleton Signature Blend?,"I recently bought a bottle of Appleton (I was looking for the 8, but settled for the Signature Blend). I tried it neat and with ice last night, and it did not go over well. It seemed overpoweringly grassy and vanilla-y, and I wasn't noticing the spiciness or richness reported of Jamaican rums (I like rye whisky, and I was assuming it would be similar in that regard). I'm given to understand that it's a better mixing rum than a sipper, which is perfectly fair for the price point. I'm just wondering what would be the best way to save this purchase (daiquiri, rum old fashioned et al.).",10,2017-03-12 01:53:41

I am planning on a tour of the Appleton Estate and looking forward to indulging in something special from their gift shop.

Questions:  Has anyone been to the gift shop recently?  Is there anything special/unique I should be looking for that I can't get back home?  Anything else I should be on the lookout for at duty free on the way in/out?

I've heard about the new ""Joy"" blend and I will have that on my radar since I don't know if it will become available in Chicagoland.  Welcome comments on that too if anyone has seen it or tried it.

**Edit:**  Damn!  Looks like the rum tour may be closed until November.

I cant find pictures of this exact label so I am not sure if it is a reserve, special edition, or just normal off the shelf bottle. It was purchased at the Bacardi Distillery at Nasau Bahamas. (around 2003) I will update with a picture later, if needed. 

It is a 1L bottle of Ron Bacardi A√±ejo with a gold cap (ive seen pictures with gold and black) and a pre 2000 logo. Under the logo is a red label, gold letters citing ""Casa Fundada en Cuba ---1862---""

Scotch is my normal weapon of choice but since there are always cadenhead rum bottles in the shop I started wondering how good they are but can't really find reviews, especially of the cask strength ones.Do you have experience with any of them ? Every help and knowledge of taste is appreciated.

My experience with rum is limited - I tasted appleton 12, abuelo 12, santa theresa 1796 and the standard green bottled diplomatico reserva exclusiva but in the end they were just too sweet for me. I like spices but not so much the typical sugar/sugar cane/vanilla taste so I would appreciate if you can recommend bottles that are more than that, or better less of that.

No idea how this will go but thanks for reading see you later!

Tour was great and really personable (it was my wife, parents, the distiller, me, and Tah-Tahs, the cat). Come time for the best part and they gave us samples of their vodka (delicious), moonshine, dark moonshine (aged in small barrels), and the oak rum. The distiller said this was his favorite and was one a Rum and bourbon made love and this was their love child. While this is my first rum that isn't bacardi or Morgan/Sailors (so take this ad you will): it's really fucking tasty. It's aged for 4 years in used bourbon barrels. It's got subtle hints of vanilla and something else I'm not quite sure. It's very sweet to say the least and nice subtle oak on the back of the tongue.

PaulWog,60ta37,7,rum,'Rum'-style: La Occidental Guayabita del Pinar,"So, my girlfriend went to Cuba for a trip. Unfortunately, I didn't give her adequate instructions. I should have told her to look for a ""12"", or at minimum a ""5"", since I didn't have a list of names of rum from cuba. So, I got what I got when she came back:

- A bargain bottle of 'rum'. I'm not sure what is the title and what is the business: ""La Occidental, Guayabita del Pinar, Fundada, 1892"". 700mL, 40%. 

Apparently it's a rum-style alcohol that is derived primarily from guava. It is clearly made with fake colour. It smells of... not much, really. The taste is round, bland, not sugary but not too dry either. There's no edge to it, it leaves the taste buds just at the same pace as it introduces itself to them, no aftertaste, no lingering. There's nothing exciting at all, no spice, no taste of molasses, no hints of vanilla or oak, no notes of whiskey. Surprisingly it is fairly dry and very easy to sip at 40% (without relying on sugar), but it's not worth sipping; this liquor is like chewing on flavourless rice crisps, it has nothing going for it. 

When mixed with coke it opens up a bit. But even with coke it's pretty bland, like a safe bet that won't offend. There's nothing bad about it. It is the tofu of rum; it's not real, it imitates appearance and style, fairly soulless. It offers a little bit of a weird vegetable/fruit flavour (from the guava), but it doesn't ruin the 'rum' &amp; coke experience (despite not technically being rum).

The legs are practically non-existent. The colour seems fake. The nose is mildly alcoholic close-up, but from further away it reveals guava. I think one of the best qualities about this rum-style liquor is that it is very smooth, despite seeming to be on the dry side.

In one word: Bland. ",2,2017-03-22 15:39:50

* The French preferred to use fresh cane juice because they were accustomed to using grape juice when making brandy.

Of those, I'm most likely to use Pusser's or Prichard's since I'd rather not mix the others unless they'd make a divine Palmetto.

Prichard's is a small distillery near Fayetteville, Tennessee, and I dont know how many have had it. So for sake of argument, what would be the best vermouth to make a Palmetto with Pusser's rum? 

I know it's going to be somewhat of a subjective thing, but if there's a general consensus, I'd rather try that first than dick around with a half dozen bottles of vermouth",4,2017-02-11 01:54:28

troyk890,5uvx0z,2,rum,Rockley Still Rums,"Rockley Still rums(Or more accurately, Rockley ""Style"" rums, as the still used is unlikely to be the actual ""Rockley Still"") are pot still rums produced at West Indies Rum Distillery (WIRD) in Barbados. They're very unique, very phenolic, tarry, and medicinal rums that are quite different from other Bajans and more reminiscent of Caroni or some of the less extreme Jamaicans.

The only two vintages I've ever seen are 1986 and 2000, they're bottled by various different IBs like Duncan Taylor, Cadenheads, Samaroli(RIP), Bristol, Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, Kill Devil, The Rum Swedes, etc. And it seems that nearly every WIRD pot still rum marked 1986 or 2000 is a Rockley Style rum even though not all of them explicitly state as much on the bottle.

I've been able to get my hands on a couple of them(the Rum Swedes 2000 and the Duncan Taylor 2000, the Rum Swedes bottle was better) and so far they've been the most memorable rums I've tried. Has anyone else tried any, and if so what bottling/vintage? I'm curious about any differences between the two vintages or even between different bottlings of the same vintage.

I've also found five bottles of the 25 year old 1986 from Duncan Taylor selling for $150 each and while I'm tempted to pick one up I'm hesitant to spend the money without reading a few reviews, and since info on Rockley Still stuff is hard to find online I'm curious if any of our resident experts here on /r/Rum have any experience with the older 1986 Rockleys.",8,2017-02-19 09:35:47

MountainMan33,5v51nv,6,rum,Blind Spirit Review #1,"Thanks to /u/ScotchChick for my first round of (posted) blind samples.

Tasted neat out of a Glencairn.

**Color:** Reflective, golden, yellow light copper

**Nose:** Super rich molasses-rum, vanilla, cane sugar residue funk, toffee, grainy-vegetal dill notes, weird, tricky bourbon notes, light baking spice and mild port wine, old oak, lots of evaporative ethanol.

**Taste:** Medium bodied molasses, light cocoa, hint of dark fruit, coconut, wood astringency, green sugar cane, over-over proof young rum.

**Finish:** Lots of heat, wood astringency, small hint of dried fruit, unremarkable, short and dry.

**Rating:** C-

**Conclusion:** Proof: 115-125. Spanish style pot still rum, aged 7-10 years.

**Guess:** Not too familiar with rums, but this one tasted like a less-rich El Dorado 12 year.

**Reveal:** [Foursquare Rum Port Cask Finished 80 Proof](/sp)

**Thoughts:** The nose on this rum is incredible and complex! (It had me thinking it was MWND finished in rum casks for a minute) Sadly, for me, the palate and finish were thin, short and too tannic for my taste. As far as the proof- this rum burnt the nose and the palate quite harshly, so I was surprised it was only 80 proof!",4,2017-02-20 23:16:53

Exceptionally light, crisp, of really pale yellow color (which many rums naturally have, until they are colored with caramel), vegetal and slightly sweet on the nose, with delicate, complex and nuanced tones on only slightly sweet background. It's produced by fermentation of fresh sugar cane juice, similar to agricole rums, and it shares some common traits.

I inherited an old bottle of Bounty Premium Rum for Christmas. 

I assume it's from around 1995 based on the fact that it says 'Gold Award 1983' and this particular Rum only got the gold award in [1983 and 1995](http://www.rum.cz/data/labels/fj/img/fj2.jpg) (That picture is the exact label minus it says 1995 for the Gold Award). Also the date code on the bottom says '28-95 |7|' (I assume 28th of July, 1995?)

Made a stop recently at an excellent specialty rum shop in Paris, and it was a great experience as a rum aficionado. They had well over a thousand rums, and the variety was amazing. They had some really old vintage rums from 1950s, some old Cuban rums, Reunion, Mauritius, Belize, Japan...

They were very friendly and offered tastings to help me select something I liked.  If you will be passing through Paris I would recommend checking it out. It's just northeast of Les Halles a block or two east of the Etienne Marcel metro stop.

Wound up picking up two bottles, and was well worth the time to look over all the different stuff. Apologies for all the missing French diacritics in this post.

I have done a quick search on this subreddit and there doesn't seem to be anything on the Manacas rum, nor Spanish soleras in general. What do you guys think of the Manacas rum, and what Spanish rums do you recommend? I'm also interested in the FAIR Rum, and the 'Plantation' range that is so oft mentioned on this thread. Any information to expand my palate would be much appreciated,
Thanks!

dokh,5p7pfk,4,rum,Carolina Agricole?,"I've never had a rhum agricole, but from the descriptions I hear of what they're like I expect to be a fan.

Unfortunately, I live in North Carolina, where all liquor stores are run by the county and so do not attempt to compete on the quality of their selection. There are, so far as I can tell, no imported rhums agricoles available in my entire state.

However, Fair Game, a local distillery and fortified winery, makes an agricole-style rum (as well as a molasses-based amber rum and a rum-like sorgum spirit). From the limited selection I've had, I'd say they're a good distiller - I'd put their apple brandy on par with any Calvados (it's superior to what I can find easily), and their ruby port-style fortified wine is better than can be expected at its price point.

Their ""Carolina Agricole"" rum is $22 for 375mL at the one store where I've seen it on the shelf. Is this price worth paying, or should I hold out for cheaper for an intro agricole?

Though, I did find it to be overpriced for what it is. At 40%, it tastes watered down a bit. On its own, it's just decent. Mixed, it's almost a little watery with coke. 

I was excited to try it, but I won't be buying it again. Not a total waste of money, but I'd have preferred to spend the extra couple bucks for Mount Gay XO or Flor De Cana 18 or something else.

HotspurJr,5hhgqw,6,rum,A little disappointed in Diplomatico.,"It's not like I feel that there's anything wrong with it - there are certain no off flavors, and it's very smooth, but it does seem kind of bland. Like - there's just not a lot going on with it. 

Granted, this is really my second or third sipping rum after the old (good) Zaya. I recognize, it retrospect, that Zaya had a ton of added sugar and vanilla, and so maybe I don't want anything that's quite that saccharine.

But I wouldn't mind just a little more going on. A little ore caramel or vanilla or nutmeg or wood than I'm getting in the DRE. 

I'd also like to not spend an arm and a leg.

I want to get him a bottle of something for Xmas, but I don't know what as all I drink is rot gut / stuff from Tesco.

Jazz-Jizz,5ixs9a,10,rum,My quest for a mid-range sipping rum - update!,"http://i.imgur.com/EnDPZLf.jpg

Last month, [I posted here to ask for advice on sipping rums that don't break the bank](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/5czopc/trying_to_find_a_decent_midrange_sipper_please/). I really appreciated the discussion it brought about, so I wanted to share my experience so far!

When I visited Kansas City (for Thanksgiving), I was able to pick up a bottle of Plantation 5-year. I haven't found the Plantation brand anywhere in my home state of Indiana so this was quite a treat. At $20 for a 750ml, the Plantation 5-year is the best sipping rum I have ever tasted. This was both a delicious rum and an amazing deal, so I'm really excited to try the higher-quality rums from Plantation. It's a damn shame the brand is apparently not available in my home state. I've almost finished this bottle and I'm savoring what little is left.

The other rum I picked up in Kansas City was Pusser's blue label. This rum is available in Indiana for $25, but it was $5 cheaper in KC so I jumped on the deal. The funkiness of the rum was hard to get used to, especially when sipping. However, I grew to love Pusser's as my go-to for a rum and coke. Milder rums get overtaken by the sweetness of Coca-Cola, but Pusser's funkiness stands up incredibly well to it. As you can see from the photo, I've completely killed off this bottle, but I think it'll become a regular in my bar because it makes an absolutely delightful rum and coke. 

I don't know if I'm ready to sip Pusser's yet, but I may end up working my way to that. A common suggestion in my last thread was that Smith &amp; Cross was the next level of funkiness after Pusser's. Hopefully I'll get a chance to try it soon. I doubt I'll enjoy it as a sipper right now, but I bet it'll make a mean rum and coke.

Lately, I've been planning on picking up a bottle of Mt. Gay Eclipse in the hopes of finding something comparable to Plantation 5-year. Eclipse is $22 here and it's made in Barbados just like Plantation 5 so I'm anxious to try it. *However*, when I went to get the Mt. Gay, I saw that Bacardi 8 was on sale. It's usually $30 here but was marked down to $25, so I took the chance to try it out. 

If Bacardi 8 is truly aged a full 8 years, then it is the oldest rum I have tried so far. This is also apparent in the darkness and complexity of the rum. The plum flavor is oddly dominant, but not necessarily in a bad way. The rum feels ""heavy"" compared to, say, Plantation 5. I'm not sure I like it, but I'm keeping an open mind. It makes a pretty good daiquiri; I'm still working on drinking it straight. As of tonight, I unequivocally prefer Plantation 5, especially considering its price in comparison to Bacardi 8.

Maybe after a couple more nights with Bacardi, I'll learn to better appreciate its complexities. I'll have a better idea once I get a chance to try some of Plantation's older offerings (but who knows when that will be). I don't know how similar Mt. Gay Eclipse will be to Plantation 5 but it'll probably be the next rum I try. At $22, if Eclipse is anything like Plantation 5, it'll definitely be my go-to. 

Has anyone had experience with any of these rums? I'd love to hear your experiences.",25,2016-12-18 09:11:26

KirethidaeUK,5jdnoc,6,rum,Good bases for a starter rum collection?,"Hi all. I'm looking to treat myself after Christmas to finally starting a rum collection when I move house with my girlfriend. I'm only 22, so I'm not the most experienced, but I've always appreciated good spirits and love trying new ones and the best ones. I've drank rum a lot, most anytime I'm drinking, for the past few years along with gin and I mostly drink it with fever tree ginger beer. I love mixing up cocktails as well though, and cocktails are essentially all my girlfriend drinks when it comes to alcohol.

My question is then, what rums should I purchase to start me off? I want versatility but I also want to purchase rums that are good starters for exploring the flavours of rums. I'm probably looking at getting either two, three or four rums. 

At the moment I was considering Appleton Estate 12YO rare blend to sip, Havana Club 7YO or Anejo Especial to use as a mixer for the majority of the time, and Plantation 3 star or Cana Brava as a silver rum for cocktails, mojitos and daiquiris. I've also been looking at a lot of the other Plantation rums such as the XO 20th anniversary, the Barbados 2001 and the Barbados 5YO, and also Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, Fair Gold and Pirate's Grog. I was initially dead set on picking up the Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva for my more expensive sipper but after finding out about the large amount of added sugars I've veered away from the idea. 

I like spicy rums, but not so much ones with strong tastes of orange zest. The flavours other than that that I'd probably prefer would be butterscotch, toffee and vanilla notes. When I drink gin, I love Opihr and the heavy spicy notes of that, but I wouldn't be too interested in cheaper spiced rums like Captain Morgans or Kraken.

I live in Ireland and am moving to the UK, but I don't think that will limit me too much because it looks like most rums are widely available online to me.

Any suggestions what I should go with? Thanks.

TheFriendlyGerm,5jlc14,3,rum,cocktails to convert this rum skeptic,"Okay, okay, so I'm not exactly *skeptical* of rum as a beverage. I enjoy a Daiquiri and a Cube Libre, and it's certainly my wife's favorite spirit. But these days I'm trying out a lot of ""short cocktail"" recipes, and struggling to include rum in my repertoire. The problem is probably the sweetness; I'm VERY sensitive to it. For example, I bought a bottle of El Dorado 8, and I'm not disliking it, but I'm struggling to find the magic in my cocktails. To be fair, it's okay in a Manhattan and a bit better in a simple Old Fashioned, but I usually prefer rye whiskeys there. I feel like I don't have much reason to move beyond an inexpensive white rum like Flor de Cana 4 Year Extra Seco.

My other problem is that many cocktails with dark/aged rum are tiki-style drinks; many of them are simply too sweet for me, and many are simply more work than I'm normally willing to spend after a long day at work and putting 3 toddlers to bed.

So in short, drier rums? Different cocktails? Or just stick to taller and more ""easy-going"" rum drinks?",20,2016-12-22 02:00:27

TheDunderhead,5c8tr2,3,rum,Upcoming goodies from the TTB,"Hunter Laing is a whisky independent bottler from the UK that has recently branched out into rum with a range of single cask, continental-aged rums, which up until now could only be found in Europe.  But last week COLAs were approved for 3 Jamaicans - a [Hampden](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16290001000062), [Monymusk](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16290001000087), and [Worthy Park](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16290001000090) (though the images mistakenly show Hampden) - under the brand name Golden Devil, imported by DJK Imports who are responsible for a number of Hunter Laing's whisky releases in the US.  Why the name change you ask?  Because there is already a Kill Devil Rum trademarked in the US by [Outer Banks Distilling](http://outerbanksdistilling.com/) of North Carolina.

The Monymusk is a 9 year old distilled in March '07 which has yet to be released in the UK.  The Hampden is a 24 year old distilled in April '92, evidently the same stock as has already been released at cask strength in the UK.  Both will be bottled at a healthy 50% ABV.  No information available on the Worthy Park thanks to the wrong labels being submitted.  No word on prices either, but I'd guess fairly steep, particularly for the Hampden.

There is also a major caveat that we can't predict how widely available these inherently limited releases will be.  A COLA could be submitted for anything from a nationwide retail release to a highly limited import available only in select bars, and is also no guarantee the rum will ever actually be released in the US.

St. Lucia Distillers are also coming out with the [5th edition of their 1931 series](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16299001000049) - according to the label, it's being bottled this Monday at 46% ABV.  That's 3% higher than prior editions, which have been pretty readily available across the country in the $70 range, so I'd expect this edition to be similar if a little pricier.

Fans of Colombian rum will also note that [La Hechicera](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16279001000353) is coming to the US.  If it's marketed anything like it is in Europe, I assume this one will have decent availability and sell in the $50 range.

Barbancourt have submitted a label for their limited edition [Cuvee 150 ans](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16286001000153), which was originally released at 43% ABV in 2012 as a 150th anniversary release.  Who knows what their intentions are, but this edition is 40% ABV and again comes packaged in a special crystal decanter, so whatever the availability it would probably cost as much as the original which was a couple hundred $.

Closer to home, Breckenridge out of Colorado are coming out with a 40% ABV [white rum](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&amp;ttbid=16298001000494) to join their spiced rum.",5,2016-11-11 00:45:37

Jazz-Jizz,5czopc,8,rum,Trying to find a decent mid-range sipper - please advise,"Hello,

I am trying to get into sipping rum, but I really can't afford to splurge a whole lot. I'd *love* to try something like Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, but $45 is a little more than I can spend right now. I haven't had much experience with rums above the $20 range. I'd be willing to drop maybe $30 on an entry-level sipper, so I'm hoping you all can give me some guidance on my limited choices in that price range.

Here's some of the nicer rums I've had to give an idea of my experience:

* Appleton Estate Signature Blend - probably my favorite I've had. Didn't like the funkiness at first but I just revisited it tonight and found I really enjoyed the tasting notes - tobacco seemed present in great way.
* Flor de Ca√±a 4 - not bad, but really too much ethanol taste to sip
* Pyrat XO - I liked it okay but it feels like drinking a liqueur

I typically keep a 1.75 of Cruzan around for a cheap mixer, plus a 1.75 of Gosling's because I love a good Dark N Stormy.

There seems to be a limited selection of rums in my price range, especially at my local liquor stores (one chain owns about every liquor store in my city so not a lot of variety here). But I've got a few potentials I'd love to get your advice on:

* Appleton Estate Reserve - $30. Next step up from the Signature so it's a logical choice, maybe?
* Flor de Ca√±a 7 - $30. I liked the 4 okay but I've heard there isn't much difference between the two.
* Smith &amp; Cross - $30. Was recommended to me, but I've heard mixed reviews because of its strength and funkiness.
* Pusser's Blue Label - $25. I hear it's marginally similar to S&amp;C being a Navy Rum but it's cheaper so I'm curious.
* Barbancourt 4/8 year - $24/32. Haven't heard much about either of these, actually. Is either worth trying?

There are also a few brands that my local stores do **not** carry at all, including Plantation and El Dorado. I've heard great things about both of these brands so it's a shame. There are a couple Mt Gay offerings, but not the XO, which is what everyone seems to recommend.

I apologize for the rambling post, but I certainly appreciate any and all advice!",58,2016-11-15 09:04:58

Sir_Donatello,5e82ro,7,rum,Foursquare Zin Finish review.,"So this is long overdue since I picked up that bottle, still haven't cracked the kirk 18 or 23, all in good time. Maybe.

Anyways. Foursquare Zinfandel Cask Finish. I'll get right to it.

Nose: rich, the fruit stands out as well as the distinct lack of alcohol. Boom. Just enjoyable, could probably smell this all day, pre drink I'm starting to pick up some nice caramel notes too. 10/10

Palate: (I'm trying a new split among my own point system so bear with me.) 

The flavor intensity/character strong, it's up front. Bold and rich, developing more of the caramel and that lovely zinfandel fruit from the casks. The oak is more present, could do without at this age but whatever, still delicious. Some light spice coming up on the finish rounds it out. 17/20

The balance: pretty well balanced, the alcohol is more pronounced on the palate rather than nose but I almost expected that to happen. Well put together rum all in all imo. 9/10

Total for palate rating: 26/30

Lastly the finish: this is where it gets docked a few points. Too short. Just couldn't carry my favoritism through to the end. The flavors remain prominent and don't dissolve, they just all kinda disappear at once. It does leave me wanting more though. 6/10

Total points 42/50. 

I  award 50pts for just making a bottle of anything. So the final rating of mine would be a 92. Definitely a recommendation. And will most likely buy again.",2,2016-11-22 09:52:59

TheMcG,55zhbd,10,rum,Saint James Royal Amber,"https://i.imgur.com/2ybWbIi.png

From the town of Saint Marie (since 1973) in Martinique, Saint James Royal Amber Rum is one of the rare agricoles that have been made available in Ontario. Rum agricole is produced using pure, fresh cane juice which is fermented into a distillers wine before being distilled through a continuous column still.

Saint James Royal Amber Rum has achieved the AOC markings for a Martinique rum. This means that all sugar cane is produced, ground, and pressed on island; no additional syrup or molasses is allowed. The final product must contain a minimal amount of added sugar. This particular product is aged for 18 to 24 months making it a younger rum.  

**Appearance (4/5):**

https://i.imgur.com/p1Ngz99.png

A fairly plain bottle design is improved by the custom markings protruding from the glass. The screw top is still a cheap presentation but appropriate for the price bracket of this product. Once in the glass it is a slightly above pale amber. 

**Nose (15/25):**

This rum solidified in my mind the reasons for multiple tasting sessions before creating these reviews. On first go-around Saint James Royal Amber Rum came off very pungent with a solvent dominating the flavour profile. On subsequent tastings while it was still present, it was no longer the dominant profile. 
Sweet orange peel shows its face as the first whiff you get from the glass. As you dig deeper you find sour grapes, and a diverse vegetal flavour that could best be described as decomposing wet leaves. Throughout a hint of nail polish remover stays with you leaving the experience wanting. 

**Flavour (30/60):**

The nose may have reduced the solvent scent that was present on subsequent tastings but on the palate it stayed strong and prominent. Unlike Armagnac, this harshness doesn‚Äôt seem to be used to expand the flavour profile - rather I personally found it to be nothing but distracting. Attempting to put that behind me I found hints of grass, raw adult spinach, and oak. A strong spice of black pepper and jalapenos closes this one out as the most dominant flavour outside the solvents. 

**Finish (6/10):**

A very long finish. This one will stay with you for some time. It is a very plain, fading spice that slowly morphs into a soft vegetal flavour stuck to your tongue. 
As you can probably tell from above, this is not to my taste. I am not a huge fan of the powerful spices or astringent scents/flavours that seem to permeate throughout this spirit. 
I can see a lot of potential in this despite its (in my personal opinion) flaws. I am very interested in finding the older members of the line up which are aged 7, 12, and 15 years respectively. 


**Total: 55/100**


**Variations:**
I added two small ice cubes and found that the nose essentially disappeared. It became faint, but the dominant scents remained - only losing out on the already weak scents. The palate on the other hand lost one of its largest defining features; the spice is completely gone. This left the drink with very little to compete with the solvent causing it to be nigh undrinkable.

TheMcG,57bre6,5,rum,What Makes A Rum For Sipping Or For Mixing,"Spawned by a discussion on my last post post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/55zhbd/saint_james_royal_amber/d8j14no)

Excluding spiced rums (for obvious reasons) 

1. How would you define one rum for sipping vs another for mixing? 
1. Would you rate a top tier mixing rum on the same scale as a sipping rum? 
2. Is a cheaper rum in your opinion automatically for mixing? 
3. And lastly one that I hadn't ever really thought about before. Do you have any white rums that you would consider a sipping rum? 

Personally I would rate it all as a sliding scale. I think I am more in line with /u/thelonecaner here where I would say that rums generally do not fall into a clear cut designation. I would say I place a rum into my mixing category when it has good bones but has flaws that need to be covered up or flavours that work best when accentuated. 

The reasoning above is why I would give all cheaper priced rums a chance at least as a sipping rum. Price doesn't immediately dictate quality.

Until recently I hadn't found a white rum I would truly call a sipping rum. Yongehurst Harbour Rum http://yongehurst.com/ which i tried recently is the first I have tried that was good enough on it's own to sip. ",12,2016-10-14 02:18:05
Osiake,57f899,2,rum,Hi! Question by a beginner looking to branch out,"Hi. It was my birthday two weeks ago (Just turned 20, Legal drinking age here in Vancouver BC is 19) and I wanted to treat myself to a nice bottle of rum but I never got around to it until now.

I've only ever had Sailor Jerrys and Kraken and I thought they're pretty decent, but I've been reading through some posts on this subreddit and I'd love to try some actual non spiced rum.

There's a bottle of Diplomatico Reserva Exlusiva in a liquor store near me, but it costs $60 CAD (At least I hope it's CAD! It shows $60 on BCliquorstores.com), would you say that's a bottle worth starting out on? If not can you recommend any others?

Thanks so much in advance.",3,2016-10-14 15:33:30

I'm excited to check out many of the resources listed here to continue my journey of taste. I was inspired to go out and try some new selections and am slowly making a target list of things to try.

I do have a pair of questions:

1) I normally drink rum neat or on the rocks. But I'm curious about cocktails that go great with a fine aged rum. What cocktails do you all normally get at the bar or make at home?

2) I ask about the cocktails as I have gained some knowledge about aging cocktails in 2-3 liter barrels and am trying to settle on a process to try out initially. Have you tried aging your own rum or cocktails in any way?

TheMcG,50qen9,15,rum,El Dorado 50th Anniversary Tasting Dinner,"Hey Everyone, a few friends and I have started a little reviewing blog and the first series I just finished putting online. Below is my write up of the El Dorado 50th Anniversary launch dinner and tasting in Toronto. Links on the names go to full write-ups on each spirit but the article contains my general opinions. Feedback is greatly appreciated. 

On May 10th 2016, Vintages hosted their first Rum tasting dinner. It was an expensive evening at $195.00 per ticket, but I think as you read on I think you can see it was worth it. The evening started with Cocktails at 6:30, in the top floor lounge of the National Club in Toronto, and moved onto a structured tasting at 7:15 followed by a five-course dinner in the impressive dining hall. The rums we were sampling throughout the night progressed through some of the best El Dorado has to offer.  

* El Dorado 3 Year Old
* El Dorado 12 Year Old
* El Dorado 15 Year Old
* El Dorado 15 Year Old Red Wine Cask
* El Dorado 15 Year Old Dry Madeira Wine Cask
* Single Barrel ICBU
* Single Barrel EHP
* El Dorado 21 Year Old
* El Dorado 25 Year Ole (1988 Distillation)
* El Dorado 50th Anniversary

In the lounge, we started with cocktails and appetizers. A choice of two cocktails was given, a variation of the Dark and Stormy featuring El Dorado 12 Year Old mixed with Ginger Beer and Mango-Orange juice, the second choice was a rum punch made with El Dorado 3 Year Old. Both were overly sweet and at mere half-ounce pour, the rum taste was nonexistent. For a drink-focused evening that was a poor introduction however, the atmosphere and a setup was amazing. It was on average a much older crowd (at that ticket price no surprise there) and nearly all were well dressed (I looked like a common peasant in my shirt and tie).


At about 7:15 the lights were dimmed and everyone was ushered into the main dining room - two level room adorned with paintings of past Canadian Prime ministers. When I had arrived, I was given a table assignment, which turned out to be great. I was seated directly next to the podium and close to where the products were on display. My table of ten fortunately was spectacular; outside one person I had arranged to meet there, I knew no one going into this event. My tablemates all ended up being on the younger side and all were major rum enthusiasts. The event organizers were quick to get a representative from Vintages up to the podium and get the night rolling. Our main speaker for the night was Shaun Caleb the Master Distiller at El Dorado.

[Shaun Caleb](https://i.imgur.com/Wgyv2qr.jpg)

Shaun‚Äôs passion for what he has accomplished and how he hopes to steer El Dorado‚Äôs products was palpable. The event was oversold with ~150 guests listening to Shaun describe the nose and palate of the first three rums. He would run into the occasional short tangent about the sourcing of the barrels or the history of the stills, which made it all the more captivating. I could have listened all evening but the kitchen was ready to serve.

Note: For full reviews, please click on the title of each rum below.

[El Dorado 15](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/7/27/el-dorado-15-year-old-special-reserve): Hands down one of the best values in premium rums on the market. Coming in at a reasonable (brace yourselves Americans) CAD$60.80 this product is mid-priced but easily outperforms many rums at much higher levels. The smooth alcohol is flavoured with citrus, spice, banana, and caramel. IT has a very sweet bouquet and palate, which is probably caused by this rum having quite a bit of added sugar.

[El Dorado 15 Red Wine Cask](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/7/30/el-dorado-15-year-old-limited-edition-red-wine-cask-finish): This is the 15yo rum aged an additional 18 months in a char level 3 cask that had been previously used for a Portuguese red wine. It is quite amazing how much this affects the flavor profile of the product. The citrus and especially the orange come through on the nose much more predominantly while it dries out the actual drink much like a full-bodied red wine. I enjoy some sweet rums and do not mind when sugar is added (as one can tell by me liking El Dorado) but this one comes to an anticlimactic ending with an overly sweet finish that was overpowering even for a sweet tooth like me

[El Dorado 15 Dry Madeira Cask](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/7/27/el-dorado-15-year-old-limited-edition-dry-madeira-cask-finish): Again aged an additional 18 months this time in a fortified Madeira Wine Cask. The nose on this product was rather toned down compared to the previous rum. Dried fruit and oak were predominant. A very dry alcohol, which had flavors of banana chips and pepper. When I went back to the Red Wine version afterwards it made it taste almost unbearably sweet. I enjoyed this one so much I bought a bottle for CAD$130.00.

[First 3](https://i.imgur.com/CTSI1HJ.jpg)

Dinner was an amazing five courses designed to pair with a corresponding rum from El Dorado. We started with a roasted sweet potato bisque with a spiced granny smith apple brunoise and cinnamon oil drizzle. I can‚Äôt lie I only took a sip of the rum while eating because I was more interested in understanding the rum on its own then with food , I took to sipping my rums after each course was finished for the rest of the night.

[Single Barrel ICBU](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/8/14/el-dorado-icbu-single-barrel): Distilled on a still originating in 1908 the ICBU single barrel rum has a sweet sugar cane note featuring hints of oak, caramel, raisins and tropical fruits. A sipping rum of high quality it goes down smooth with very little burn. The palate of the rum featured oak, coconut, oranges, tobacco and spice.

The second course was a Panko-crusted crab cake on a grilled pineapple salsa and mini salad. This was paired with the EHP Single Barrel. The pineapple tied in well with the tropical fruit flavors of the rum; but once again, I mostly skipped pairing it with the food.

[Single Barrel EHP](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/8/14/el-dorado-ehp-single-barrel): Another from the single barrel (or connoisseur line as El Dorado Likes to call it) this rum aged for 12 years (but no age statement on the bottle). The light aroma starred apple and orange as the prominent scents. On the palate it came with the pear, cinnamon, oak, and a light undertone of caramel. I actually thought this would have gone better with the first course, but hey, I am not a chef.

Main course was the best beef tenderloin I have had in my life. It was served on buttermilk mashed potato, saut√©ed heirloom carrots and covered in a cabernet demi-glace. The meat was so tender and cooked to perfection; it essentially melted in your mouth. This was paired with the excellent 21 Year Old Special Reserve.

[El Dorado 21 Special Reserve](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/8/21/el-dorado-21-year-old): My go to sipping rum at home, and one of the only ones I had enjoyed in reasonable amounts before this event. Caramel, raisin, orange peel, and almonds all make their appearance in the nose of this rum. The alcohol in this rum by far the warmest of the evening and you can really feel its presence on the way down. The palate is treated to an array of flavours including; oak, a strong caramel, raisins, prunes, and other dry fruits. 

The assorted cheese plate starred three cheeses, Roquefort Carles, Avonlea Clothbound Cheddar, and Lindenhof Raw Milk Gouda. It also came with assorted breads and small amounts of honey and balsamic reduction. Paired with the flagship 25 year old Demerara Rum. This was the first course that I think I really understood the pairing. The soft and bitter flavours with the cheese mixed with the sweetness of the honey and balsamic brought out some of the better characteristics of the rum.

[El Dorado 25 Year Old Demerara Rum](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/8/21/el-dorado-25-1988-distillation): This is from the 1988 distillation which I had not yet tried, my bottle at home being from the 1986 run. The nose is very sweet with candied orange, toffee, honey and almond. It goes down very smooth and tastes of banana, honey, almonds, caramel and oak.

[Desert](https://i.imgur.com/2uheqnb.jpg)

Desert was an obvious move to really showcase what El Dorado believes to be the main characteristics of the star pairing of the evening; El Dorado 50th anniversary. It was a sticky toffee pudding with a nest of honey sticks resting on it, a flamb√©ed banana slice, a caramel chip with banana sorbet, and exactly three raspberries. The raspberries must have just been there for colour but the rest was bang on for flavours in the rum. This dessert was an amazing ending to an amazing night.

[El Dorado 50th Anniversary](http://www.charredbarrel.com/home/2016/8/22/el-dorado-50th-anniversary-grand-special-reserve): From a combination of 5 distillates ranging in 33-50 years of age, I was expecting a much stronger scent especially for one aged in such a hot climate. The nose hints at banana, honey, fig, marzipan, and a sweet charred oak.  Smoother than I thought could be possible for a well-aged rum, although it is slightly sour on the tongue. The nose gave away most of it secrets, banana, honey, fig, marzipan all make an appearance. Caramel and fruits round out the tastes.

The evening wrapped up with the pitch to buy some bottles. I personally bought the EHP, ICBU and 15 Year Old Madeira Wine Cask bottles. I would have loved to buy a 50th anniversary but unfortunately, at $3500.00 a bottle it was a touch outside my price range. For the first ever rum tasting hosted by Vintages, I have to say it was amazing. The night was well worth it, excellent speakers, excellent products, and excellent company. If we can expect this quality from their spirit events, I will certainly be attending what they have to offer in the future.

sagaciouszu420,517ybh,2,rum,First cocktail comp. Need help creating a rum based liqueur,"so im currently entering my first cocktail competition, and i'm looking for advice the competition is for angostura, with the rules stipulating that the cocktail must have 25ml of any angostura rum as a minimum, and at least 5 dash's of any of their bitter's combined, while still being tiki/tropical. 

After much deliberation i think i have the idea for what im gonna do for the cocktail,(my original idea was a chocolate orange espresso daquiri, nice but alas nowhere near tiki enough) it was either go for a twist on a classic tiki cocktail, such as a headhunter or waikiki, or create something original.  After looking at Trinidadian culinary culture, and how bitters can be used within that,  i decided to base my cocktail on a mango chow, which infuse's the sweet flavour of mango with herbs and spice's. 

The main problem i now face is getting all these complex flavour's to mix perfectly, i have 3 weeks to get it down, and i was thinking of creating a liqueur from an overproof rum( most likely wray) infusing mango, honey, garlic, s+p, cilantro, some sort of pepper(was thinking scotch bonnet's but may be be too hot) and possibly some citrus fruit's. This is were i need a hand.

I will state that im not new to the game, and although this is my first comp, i have created menu's and the like before, but i've been mainly gin based and away from tiki for a while. So i really want to do good with this one, and any help at all would be appreciated massively.

TL,DR  first cocktail comp, angostura, needs to have a lot of bitter's, want to create a liqueur based of Trinidad mango chow.

Apologies for any bad grammar, im bad at it. Unfortunately that will never change.

MoviesAndCocktails,51ymp8,7,rum,Hamilton pot still black,"I recently acquired a bottle of this rum and I am not quite sure what to make of it. This is a crazy bottle of rum! It has the nice Jamacian funk I love, but the fruitiness of it is like a kick in the mouth. So far I have tried it with ginger beer and Coke. In both cases the rum really jumps out and dominates the drink. I have 2 questions.

First, what's the best thing to do with a rum like this? It's clearly not a sipper. In normal ratios, it seems like not the right rum for ginger beer or Coke. Maybe half and half with another rum would work better, but I feel like it is a bit too much by itself. It seems to me that since it has such a strong fruitiness, that it would work best in a rum drink that has other juices in it. Any recommendations?

My second question is how would you describe the character of this rum. I get molasses, maybe some raisins, and what comes across to me as a bunch of old bananas lying out in the sun. My roommate disagrees about the bananas and mostly tastes the molasses. How would you guys describe this?",6,2016-09-10 01:38:05

That became my speciality but for 'nights out' I settled on Captain Morgan's Spiced with Diet Coke...

... until I found Kraken Dark Spiced rum... which has been a 'gateway rum' for some of my more sceptical friends.

Either way, I'm a Bourbon, Scotch and Beer drinker mostly but lately I've been getting disappointed in a lot of the Scotch I find, maybe my palate is changing, but I've been craving something sweeter and even the Highlands aren't doing it for me. I've also been really intrigued by more tropical fruity flavors such as Banana's, Coconut and Molasses and figured this is a good place to start. I'm willing to drop 40-80 on something reasonably good, but I'm also willing to go down towards the cheaper range. I'm a big fan of mulled wine as well, so maybe that can help give you a bit of an idea. As far as Scotches, I really love the peaty stuff, but like I said I've been trying to expand and tried a Balvenie Scotch and I kind of thought to myself, wow I really like the sweetness of it. Anyway, thoughts and recommendations folks? Thanks!

Eclectix,4y0w5f,7,rum,My visit to the Key West Legal Rum Distillery,"This visit was not planned; I just popped in while I was in town. As such, I happened to be there during non-production hours. This means that there was no distiller there to give me a proper tour nor answer my questions; however, the barista was fairly knowledgeable and I was able to go into the distillery and look around for myself.

The distillery allows one free sample, or for $11 you can sample a variety and take home a souvenir shot glass. The samples were served in single-use plastic ""sacrament"" cups (fitting for a Sunday morning). All of them were served ice cold except for their aged rums which were served at room temperature. The samples were sufficient to get a good taste of the rums. Their rums are made from evaporated sugar cane, not from molasses.

The rums:

**Key West First Legal Rum**: This is a straight white rum. It is surprisingly smooth. It may be my new go-to mixer for daiquiris, as it has a basic rum flavor that is simple and pleasing, and not too expensive.

**Duval Street Spiced Rum**: This was the most surprising of the rums I sampled. Forget about your typical spiced rum; this is nothing like the usual stuff. Not very sweet at all, it was more reminiscent to me of bitters than spiced rum. In fact, one could use this to make a rum old fashioned and just leave the bitters out of the mix. The barista confirmed only the presence of coriander and basil. The strongest flavors to me were clove, citrus, coriander, and basil.

**Real Key Lime**: This is one of their various ""chef's"" rums. I love key limes. That said, this rum would be better used for mixing than for sipping, and I think the rum is not best sampled by tasting it straight, as it is rather sour. Not sweet or syrupy, it tastes very much like rum and key lime juice.

**Vanilla Br√ªl√©e Dark**: Another chef's rum, this is also surprisingly less sweet than one might expect. Caramel and vanilla are obviously strong players in this rum, as well as a certain woody characteristic. I am a huge fan of quality vanillas, and thus I am put off by inferior vanilla flavors, but this rum did not disappoint. I brought a bottle of this home with me. I would sip on this rum for the vanilla flavor, but it would also be excellent for cooking or mixing. Some sediment formed on the bottom of the bottle after a couple of weeks, which I believe reflects the fact that this rum is an infusion of real vanilla, and not imitation vanilla flavor.

**Green Coconut**: Yet another chef's rum. We've all had the syrupy coconut rum that calls to mind suntan lotion. This is not that rum. Not particularly sweet, it tastes more like fresh coconut water. It would probably be good in a mixed drink, but I would not use it in a pi√±a colada as the coconut flavor is too subtle and would be wasted. 

**Key West Devil's Rum**: Basically this is cinnamon flavored rum. In keeping with their other rums, this is not terribly sweet or syrupy; otherwise it calls to mind the cinnamon flavor of Fireball Whiskey.

**Bad Bitch Rum Spanish Marie**: This was the first of the two aged varieties I sampled. It was crafted and named in honor of the famous rum runner, Marie Waite. As such, it is aged in wine barrels because she was recorded as having used whatever barrels were on hand, which were often port wine barrels. I have to say that for me, this was my least favorite. It is unique, complex, and rather interesting, but perhaps because I'm not a fan of tannic flavors (and not a fan of wine in general) I simply didn't care as much for it.

**Aged Key West Raw and Unfiltered Rum**: Slightly cloudy and amber in color, this tastes pretty much like you expect aged rum to taste. I'd call it a decent value. Not as smooth as I would have hoped, it easily passes as a sipping rum but not as a high-end sipper. I brought home a bottle for my collection, and I think it will be good as a general mixing rum.

They do offer other rum flavors which were not on the sample menu, including a cheaper version of their basic white rum and an overproof rum, as well as a few other chef's rums.

PaperPhoneBox,4yjs69,12,rum,Rum before it is rum?,"I was reading the process of how rum is made and a question arose that maybe someone could answer.

To simplify the process, sugar cane gets squeezed into sugar juice (or boiled to syrup or made to molasses) then fermented. 

At this point it is similar to the beer making process, a sugar liquid is fermented. Unlike beer the fermented sugar stuff is distilled and its alcohol is separated from the wort and made into the rum we love.

My question is could you drink that wort, skipping the distillation process? My thought is that it can be treated like a beer especially if the rum wort was made directly from cane juice (not thickened into syrup or molasses that is).

Rallerboy888,4qwwis,6,rum,Help with Demerara rums,"Hi lads!

So, a few months ago I attended a Rum Nation tasting. It was a properly good experience, and I must say that they know how to pick and blend rum!

My absolute favorite from the night was their Demerara Solera N¬∞14, which is obviously from Guyana. Now, I would love to find a rum with a similarly rich profile, but my only other dabbling in Guyana rum is El Dorado 12. I'll be honest, it didn't strike me as particularly good, and I found it fairly rough.

Can anyone recommend something similar to the Rum Nation bottling? I obviously also like Zacapa 23, but I don't recognise it as anything special. It has no character, but the balanced sweetness is nice.

Thanks!",18,2016-07-02 19:32:38

I'm playing around with a cocktail called a ""stone fence"".  It's made with hard cider and rum, particularly pot distilled rum from molasses.  I've got a good handle on my whiskeys, but I am not a big rum drinker, and so I thought I'd ask you all what your suggestions are for a good rum that fits the criteria mentioned above.  I've had two people suggest two different bottles - one was Kraken, the other Black Seal by Goslings.  Are those my two best options, or are there other high quality molasses rums done in pot stills (holy shit, and I used to make fun of hipsters?) that I'm overlooking?

Thanks for your time all!  If you're interested in the stone fence, fill a pint glass with ice, add 2oz of rum, and top with hard cider.  Stir and go.  Citizen Cider's ""unified press"" is hard to beat...",14,2016-07-21 04:33:26

Devoz,4tx50r,24,rum,When is a rum not a rum? - Tales of the Cocktail,"For those who do not know, every year the largest cocktail festival occurs. There are many seminars, talks, tastings, etc. This year there was a moderated debate as to what really is a rum, along with problems facing the rum market. 


It quickly degraded into a mudslinging contest, but some interesting points and issues were raised: 


* Sugar source - does sugar beer and sorghum molasses count as a proper base for rum? (cheap shot at Lost Spirits)

* Clement Importer objecting to proposed requirement for coloring and flavoring on labels - ""too much information for consumers"" 

* One distiller says that adding flavor disclosure would be redundant if ""rum is on the label 

* Should rum spend time inside a barrel? 

* ""No sugar added/sugar-free"" on labels? Would that change your buying decision? 

* Age statements (youngest rum in bottle vs. Solera method) - is Solera method deceiving? 


* ""Fake"" age statements hurt those companies which put actual age of the youngest rum, due to high loss of spirit during maturation. Plantation in favor of Solera system, others not so much. 

* Multi-column distillation vs pot still? Should rum only be pot still/traditional column still? 

* Vanillin in white rum - Bacardi against people adding it 

* Should rum focus more on proof or additives in the product? 

* Is there too much sugar in rum? Some argue that added sugar is part of the history and tradition of rum 

* Does rum have to be sweet? 


Some interesting thoughts. 


Personally I think solera age statements are misleading, especially to the general consumer. 


As for added sugar, many of my favorite brands are those with it. And I can except the traditional process argument that goes along with it. 


Other flavoring additives I am not a fan of, you run this risk of becoming a ""rum"" flavored vodka. 


Anyone have thoughts on some of the points that were discussed? ",41,2016-07-21 22:08:36

As I understand it, the Cuv√©e Homere is a blend of rhums from the last 15yrs. Surely some of the cuv√©e will be younger than 15yrs so it makes me wonder if it is worth it seeing as the rhum in the 10yr will be at least 10yrs old if not older. I know older doesn't always mean better but from a value standpoint, the 10yr seems to be the way I'm leaning. If anyone has experience with both of these I would appreciate any insights.

What are 3 rums that you would recommend to pair with:

- light cigars, (flor de selva robusto)

- fresh hand rolled cuban cigar, so a bit more powerfull and notes light hay and fresh grass

- darker, fuller blend cigars, (san lotano oval and vila zamorano)

pars-ifal,4pgqec,8,rum,Advice on barrel-enhancing (x-post from r/alcohol),"Hey guys, won't bore you with the backstory but basically I'm planning on putting some white rum (probably Bacardi) in a 1-litre white oak barrel with a vanilla pod or two to try and make something a little more unique for my dad.

I'm not looking to make some world-changing beauty of a rum, and I'm looking to alter the flavour rather than aging the spirit, so will probably only keep it in the barrel for about a month.

The bit I'm not sure about is how much vanilla will be enough to flavour the rum without overpowering it.

Any advice about any part of this would be awesome, including which rum would be best! I was thinking Bacardi because it's relatively cheap in case I mess up the first batch, but if there's anything better for the job then please do let me know. Thanks guys.",15,2016-06-23 21:29:11

I live in Flensburg (Northern Germany, at the border with Denmark). The City has a 400 year rum-distilling tradition, since it was the main Danish port for colonial trade back then (Mainly for sugar and rum).  Today there are just the reputation and about three or four rum-houses with their ‚ÄúGerman Flavored Rum‚Äù left (There once were about one hundred.
During the demolition of an old rum-house about 300 bottles were found. Those bottles are about one hundred years old and were once filled with rum. 
The rum-museum of the city decided to fill those bottles, fittingly, with rum. They bought one barrel of 11 years old rum from Barbados. The wooden barrel was transported by a Dutch barque called ‚ÄúTres Hombres‚Äù across the Atlantic to Amsterdam and from there by a chartered sloop to Flensburg. The transport took about three months and it happened only with the force of wind.
Finally the bottles are filled and one of them is mine!

obeythehypnotoad,4h9cjw,14,rum,"I visited the Malahat distillery in San Diego, California","Paid an unplanned visit to [Malahat Spirits](http://www.malahatspirits.com/#about) this weekend and thought I would give a brief report.

Malahat is a tiny operation. They've been distilling since 2013. They do a ""tour"" (the whole operation is right behind the bar) where they explain the process. They've got a column still and a pot still. There was a small third still also that they use for some something special (can't remember). Everything is done by hand, including processing spices, labeling bottles, etc. 

We also had a tasting. By state law they can't serve more than 1.5 oz per person per day, so I didn't get a thorough taste of their rums but enough to say a few things. 

They showed off six spirits:

* A young bourbon (18 months?) that I found enjoyable. I don't have much bourbon experience but it was tasty. 
* Their white rum. This I found very interesting. I think this is half of what they've got going for them, the unaged rum is quite tasty. 
* Their spiced rum. This was very sippable but I'm not sure as a spiced rum it really floats my boat. Definitely different. A little thin -- I'm probably used to sugar in spiced rum which this lacks. 
* Their ginger rum. 70 proof, light and not overpowering. Everyone liked this except me. 
* A black tea infusion rum. This is just one of their many experiments, not for distribution. 
* Finally, a 2.5 year aged rum. This is coming out soon. Bottles at 92 proof. I really liked this. I wouldn't have guessed it was that young. The weather in San Diego may have something to do with this; in the summer there are daily temperature swings from 100F to 60F. 

Final note, they do not add sugar post distillation to any of their spirits. For the most part I think it isn't needed anyway. 

It was worth the visit if you're in SD. You won't spend more than an hour there so it's not really worth traveling just for the tour. Looking forward to seeing that run on shelf!",8,2016-05-01 22:52:39

https://imgur.com/a/N2PRL

Distilled in 2005
Aged 8 years
ABV 63.6%

Color: golden amber
Nose: first notice a sweetness. Caramel, vanilla, Burnt sugar,  and mollasses. Those aromas then mingle with smells of tropical fruit and slight smoke. Sweet juiciness along with the wonderful smells of burnt sugar and smoke/char are more than welcoming. 

Taste: Right off the bat I can taste fruit, noteably pineapple. Burnt sugar and vanilla are there just like in the nose. This is quickly followed by the taste of barrel and lots of char. The spirit is warming on the palate. Slight burn and slight astringency. As the burn and astringency of this high proof spirit releases your palate from it's grasp... A pleasantly warm long finish of woodiness, char, dark fruit, and mollasses awaits you. 

Overall, I really enjoy this rum. High proof and full of flavor. If you like scotch, you may find some characteristics in this spirit that will be familiar to you. I will most likely be buying a second bottle. Still a little rough around the edges (I'd love to see how this would compare to say... 12 years of aging) but it is complex, flavorful  and is certainly an unapologetic rum!

ABV: 68.2%

https://imgur.com/a/ptYmz

Color: golden amber

Nose: Herbal. Brown sugar, sarsaparilla, wintergreen, cinnamon sticks, vanilla

Taste: initially I taste barrel, tropical fruits (notably pineapple), and mollasses. Burn kicks in. Tingles the tongue. Sarsaparilla, wintergreen, anise/fennel, and vanilla enter the picture. The burn fades, leaving a long grippy finish. I continue to taste mollasses, sarsaparilla, and wintergreen long after setting down the glass. Slight leatheriness detected along with some peat and smoke/char. 

Overall this rum delivers a lot of flavor to the palate. Complex and aggressive. Rum for scotch drinkers for sure. Always been a fan of the guys at Blackadder.

Blackadder Raw Cask Rum Fiji Rum 11 Year.

Distilled 2001

ABV 63.9%

Color: Coppery Amber.
 Bottle has a bunch of charred bits from the cask resting on the bottom.  Gotta love these unfiltered bottlings!

Nose: it's dark, rich, a little funky. Leather, rubber, and juicy molasses (notably pineapple and apricot) backed up by woodiness. Clove and vanilla are present. 

Taste: upon the first sip, I taste the sweet fruity mollasses and leather I smelled earlier. Once I begin moving the spirit around my palate astringency kicks in with a satisfying burn. Heavy wood, saw dust, takes over for a long finish that mingles with maple syrup and malty chocolate notes reminiscent of scotch. The finish is balanced, drying but leaves you with mouthwatering reminders of the initial sip -- mollasses, apricot, and leather. Holds up when water is added.

I think this, along with the Blackadder st Lucia I reviewed, are rums fit for drinkers who are seeking funky bold spirits. This bottle is certainly one of those rums that bridge the gap between the scotch and rum worlds. I prefer the St Lucia so far over this Fijian bottling. However, still with trying. If you see this one in the store, jump on it!

Gunroom Navy Rum

ABV 65%

Blend of rums from Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad, and Barbados.

Color: Golden

Nose: I pick up butterscotch, burnt sugar, and raisins. Leather, vanilla, tropical fruits along with woodiness mingle in the background.

Palate: Initially I taste lots of funky mollasses, dark fruits, butterscotch, and caramel. This makes me think of aged Jamaican pot still rums. As the burn sets in, leather, wood, and spice come into play. 

Body is heavy with a great mouthfeel. The rum is viscous and it stands up to the addition of water (although I don't think it needs it). 

Overall, I taste the influence of the Jamaican and Demerara rums most. Gunroom Navy Rum is bold, flavorful  and well balanced. Despite having a whopping 130proof stamped on the label, I find it enjoyable to sip on neat and would be well suited for mixing up tiki cocktails.

ricecracker420,4ecskm,10,rum,"New to rum, have some questions","Hello /r/rum 

I'm training to become a bartender, and my particular bar does not really do rum cocktails.  Because of this, the bartenders training me don't really know rum too well.  I've posted similar questions to /r/cocktails and /r/tiki, and have gotten even more confused.  I want to stock my home bar and would love some solid (but not incredibly expensive) options for rum.  

I understand that rum is an incredibly complex subset of liquor, so I'm looking for a white, a gold, a dark, and an aged rum that would all be useful in a wide range of cocktails.

Also, can you guys clarify what appleton signature is classified as?  I got recommendations for it as a gold rum, an aged rum, and as a dark rum, while that makes it seem versatile, that also seems silly

Edit:  Thank you for all the suggestions!  My wallet feels quite a bit lighter, but the mai tai I just made was incredible!

If you're curious, here's what I picked up:

el dorado 12  

clement premier canne

Barbancourt 8 year

It had everything I wanted in a sipping rum, a strong enough bite with a sweet and lasting finish. Last week I bought the Zacapa 23 after reading a few things off this sub and I have got to say I was a little let down.

I tried Shellback once (which was like drinking cake frosting), but my usual drink is Sailor Jerry. The supermarket was having a sale on Bacardi so I went in intending to grab a bottle of Silver, but then I saw the Black and read on the label that it's ""aged between one and three years in heavily charred oak barrels, then shaped through a secret blend of charcoals"".  Being more of a bourbon drinker, I thought that sounded pretty good, so I bought a bottle. As soon as I opened it and took a whiff, however, I knew I'd made a big mistake. 

If you dissolved a bar of soap in a liter of store-brand diet cola, it would probably taste a lot like Bacardi Black. It is the vilest alcohol I've ever tasted -- and I've tasted Ron Caballero rum. It's as if an executive at Bacardi accidentally put a topical anti-fungal cream on his toothbrush instead of toothpaste, and when he tasted it he thought ""Hmm, we should make a rum that tastes just like this!"" 

I just can't imagine why any company would intentionally manufacture a product that tastes so godawfully bad. So my question is this: is there some real rum that tastes like this? What was Bacardi aiming at?",29,2016-03-02 22:14:14

I am a long time whisky drinker, mainly single malts such as Lagavulin, Caol Ila, and Scapa, but have been know to drink plenty of whiskies and bourbons.

I have been drinking rum for a long time as well, although it would normally be Captain Morgan's Original or Kraken, and usually mixed with coke, ginger beer or orange juice (don't knock it... prevents scurvy).

Recently I felt I should venture in to rum appreciation the way I appreciate whisky.  I had no idea where to start though!

While on holiday last week I tried some Pampero Aniversario and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I wasn't sure what I was ordering but recognised the Pampero name, and I liked the bottle.

I'm not going to ask the usual ""what next"" questions, there is enough information on here already.  Although any hints and tips would be greatly appreciated.

What I would like to ask is about matching rum and food.  Everyone knows a glass of whisky is perfect with a steak, and James Buntin, ambassador for The Balvenie, has written about pairing whisky and cheese.  I have had the privilege of attending his masterclass.

Are there any particular dishes, or foods which you feel are complemented particularly well by rum... or vice versa?

I would love to know your thoughts, and thank you in advance.

Clogman,4anjbc,5,rum,Oliver's Exquisito 1995 and Ron Zacapa XO,"So my birthday is comming up and i wanted some nice rum for my birthday.
Since i got introduced to rum by tasting the Ron Zacapa 23, the zacapa's are speciel for me, and therefor also the Ron Zacapa XO.

So i  ordered it and on a whim i ordered the Oliver's Exquisito 1995 too since i read positive things about it.

I tried the Exquisito first and was pleasently surprised by it, it reminds me a lot about Ron zacapa 23 so that is a plus in my book.

Then i tried the RZ XO, and even though it was a nice taste, i was a bit disapointed after trying the Exquisito.

Since this was my second disappointment after my Ron Quorhum 30 disappointment, im starting to think i might as well go for rums that are half the price of RZ XO's and the like since they taste just as good.

Maybe it is impossible to say a rum that is twice as expensive should be twice as good? since people's palettes are different.

For me i think i will just collect bottles below the RZ XO price range since i find they are just as good.

What are people's experience when it comes to price versus quality ?",7,2016-03-16 20:20:32

PaulWog,4bednw,3,rum,New to rum: Can anyone answer my questions?,"I picked up a few rums the other day to taste and compare. To get straight to the point, here are my questions:

1) I can't really find a good comparison of the El Dorado 15 Year and the El Dorado 12 Year. My favourite rum right now is El Dorado 12. I'm wondering if the 15 year tastes of oak a lot more (something I don't want), or if it's really worth the step up. I could buy nearly two 12-years for the price of one 15-year, so there has to be some good reason.

2) Are there any good spiced rums out there that are worth trying that aren't too sugary? I have tried Kraken, and I have tried Bacardi Oakheart. Kraken is like a vanilla mystery sugar drink, and oakheart is even more sugary and is like butterscotch. Neither are bad, I prefer the Kraken out of the two. I like spiced rum, but I don't want to waste a ton of money trying a slew of other brands only to find that it's just purely vanilla and rum flavor. 

3) Has anyone tried Mount Gay XO? I picked up a bottle to taste it, and I don't actually get what is great about it. It's bitter on the aftertaste neat, and it mixes kind of harsh in coke. I will revisit it (I have the bottle), but I'm not sure if it's just me being inexperienced.

4) Right now my top two rums out of sampling 6 or so would be the El Dorado 12, and the Appleton 12. Are there any similar rums you might recommend? Both of these rums are distinctly different, but I can say I am not a fan of Mt Gay, or Flor De Cana 18. The El Dorado is smooth, sugary, complex, and tastes good no matter how you drink it. The Appleton 12 is more spicy, not as smooth, but it's complex and interesting no matter how you drink it. ",25,2016-03-22 05:28:34

Cyberfit,4bs3ul,5,rum,El Dorado 12: ‚Öì as sweet as Coca Cola,"So I ran some calculations for a comment in another rum thread and realised that El Dorado 12 is one third as sweet as Coca Cola is. I knew it was sweet, but I was baffled by this realisation considering that Coca Cola is literally packed with sugar with acid added to make it drinkable.

&amp;nbsp;

El Dorado 12: 35g/L  
Coca Cola: 106g/L

Apparently El Dorado 12 also has 4g/L of unknown extracts.

mawo333,4bzj0f,16,rum,"Today I learned, that I used 400‚Ç¨ Rum to bake cake","A little story first how this all happened.

Some years ago, I wanted to make a cake, I was younger, didn¬¥t know anything worthy about alcohol (well we all drank Jack and Coke, but that doesn¬¥t give you knowledge).

So I went to my parents liquor cabinet which has been basically unused apart from when my mum needed alcohol for baking cakes and stuff.
The noname rum we used for baking was empty, so I just opened another bottle of rum.

Parents later came home, made no fuzz about it, because they also didn¬¥t care about it.

Later I learned that they bought it in Cuba in the early 70s, but I thought ""ok, but it is still just a big company rum, so I didn¬¥t do anything bad"".

Now some years later, I started with cocktails and the bottle was still  there, and I took it, nothing had been used from it, but those few spoons that I had needed. Just last week I made some Mai tais of it for a start.

Today some guy on reddit  talked about not knowing the value of an old bottle of Brandy.

That moment I remembered this story and googled the bottle

- Plantation 3 star silver (700ml) - $55    

- Diplomatico Blanco Reserve (700ml) - $70  

- Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva (700ml) - $100  

- El Dorado 5yr aged (750ml) - $85

- Appleton extra 12yr (750ml) - $65  

- Angostura 1919 (700ml) - $65  



It seems if you aren't a fan of the more mainstream stuff like Bundaberg, Barcardi, etc you're not going to find any of the good stuff for under $55.  I understand it's all a matter of preference, and it's hard extrapolating prices from one country to another, but IMO for a lot of the prices being asked for what are considered entry-level 'good' rums you can almost get better value going whiskey/whisky or bourbon instead (again depending on your drinking preferences).",13,2016-01-30 10:08:38

obeythehypnotoad,4576b7,7,rum,Ron Centenario 7 Anejo Especial mini review,"Picked up a bottle of Ron Centenario 7 Anejo Especial in a San Francisco BevMo a few weeks ago for around $24.  Side note:  the SF BevMo on Van Ness is gigantic, easily twice as large as the ones I frequent in SoCal.  They had several rums I haven't seen locally.

This is a Costa Rican rum.  According to their website it is a blend of rums all of which were aged 7 years.

I enjoy trying out new rums that aren't terribly expensive.  This time around I struck gold.  It's on the dry side, just a hint of sweetness (natural or otherwise, it's at least not a sugar bomb).  A nice mix of brown sugar notes and vegetation.  I won't attempt to describe its flavor beyond that.  The flavor is unique enough to stand out but not enough to feel out of place.

I'll list only one complaint:  the cap.  I opened it up to find a weird plastic contraption on the mouth of the bottle.  I poured it into a glass and nothing happened.  Tried again, just a drop or two dribbled out.  I literally had to search the internet to find that you need to shake it a bit to get the rum flowing out of it.  It's some kind of weird anti-re-bottling device.  Now that I've drained the bottle a little bit it seems to flow normally.  Strange.

One other confusing thing:  the name.  ""Ron Centenario"" I'm pretty sure translates to ""Rum 100th anniversary"".  I think it's a poor choice of name given other brands have Centenario rums (Zacapa, etc).

Anywho, if you see some of this I think it's a pretty good cheap buy.",9,2016-02-11 12:58:23

ScrumpleRipskin,45txk4,1,rum,What does oxidized rum smell/taste like?,"I've never run into a situation where I've asked to return booze but I did tonight. I got a 375ml bottle of Pyrat labelled from Anguilla, 2008. When I cut the plastic, the cork crumbled apart from the top and I had to carefully use my cork screw to extract the rest without it falling in. The inside of the neck had a gross mushy wood residue layer that I couldn't wipe out.

After smelling and tasting, it just didn't seem 'right.' It didn't have characteristics I'm used to with my two favorites, Zaya and Zacapa, but I'm no rum connoisseur. It smelled mostly of straight alcohol and had a weird, almost raisin-y taste.

Thankfully the shop was gracious enough to accept a return (I hate being a pain in the ass to small mom and pops operations) and I exchanged it for Zacapa (+ the remaining price.)

When I returned I compared the two since I still had some in a glass.  The old Pyrat was much lighter in color as well. The owner said it was normal but didn't want to lose a customer over it and didn't want to give me another Pyrat just to have the same thing happen and I agreed.

Is what I experienced a normal thing? Do you think something was possibly wrong with the old bottle I returned or was I just an inexperienced and shitty customer?",5,2016-02-15 08:41:07

It all comes from sugar cane right?

While rhum agricole distills directly from the sugar cane juice itself? I'm confused and finding literature on the topic on the internet is not proving easy.

KGaang,47hibp,3,rum,Searching for a specific rum or similar tasting rum.,"Hey, r/rum! I've got a request for you.

First of all, I'm not a big drinker. I can't stand the smell and taste of most alcohol. I'm sure I'll grow out of it one day, but that day isn't anytime soon. That having been said...a few months ago I visited Scotland and a bartender in Edinburgh served me my first ""official"" drink. Green Island Spiced Gold rum with lemonade. I fell in love and haven't stopped thinking about it since. 

I've tried a couple of other rums - Capt. Morgan and Kirkland (yes, as in Costco) and both of those were way to smoky for me. What drew me to the Green Island is the sweetness (i.e. brown sugar, vanilla) and the complete and total lack of smoke. The smokiness of other rums and whiskey is way too strong for me.

The problem is as far as I know I can't order that stuff to be delivered to the States (Colorado to be more specific). Maybe I'm wrong and have just been looking in the wrong places, I don't know. I'm not really knowledgeable on the workings of ordering alcohol over the internet (my sister who is of legal age would get it for me by the way, I'm not trying to buy alcohol online while underage). I also can't find it in any shops nearby. I'm turning 21 in May and was hoping to actually have a drink that I enjoy to celebrate.

Is there anywhere I could find this rum in the States or order it online anywhere? If not, does anyone know of any rums that taste similar?

Thanks!",6,2016-02-25 13:49:59

But after tasting it i must admit i was a bit disapointet and that is where my ""problem"" lies now.
The aftertaste was very round and mild almost boring and i actually missed the bit of heat that the Ron zacapa 23 has, so it doesn't get to sweet.

So is this just me being a newb? my tastebuds not being ""developed"" yet ?
Will this experience be the same if i get other high end rums like Ron Zacapa 30 Aniversario and other ?

Papa's Pilar 24 is an 86 proof solera blended rum sourced from Florida, the Caribbean, and Central America.  The oldest rum in the blend is 24 years and the rums are aged in Bourbon barrels, Port wine casks, and then it is blended and finished in Spanish Sherry casks (as I understand).  This particular bottle came from a 67 barrel lot that was further aged for 120 days in freshly emptied Bourbon barrels. I was not able to find much more information about the blending process, unfortunately.

I've worked my way through almost half the bottle (in various glassware) and here is my review:

The bottle is a looker! Meant to mimic an infantryman' s canteen from WWI this bottle has a heavy round shape and an engraved compass on the lid.  The blend itself is named after Ernest Hemingway's boat, The Pilar, and the bottle is a nod to his service as an ambulance driver in the First World War.

Unfortunately the shape leads to lots of spills or very heavy pours until you've reached 1/4 of the way down.  Just pour heavy, you'll want more anyway.

I like to let this rum breathe for 10-15 minutes before enjoying otherwise the ethanol is a bit strong.  While it's breathing I get a strong maple and brown sugar smell next to me.  When I start nosing the glass a light fruit (peach or apricot?) and baked sugar cookie smell greets me along with the maple.  Then you get the good ol dark rum spices; cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.

When I'm finally done nosing around I go for the taste.  Right off the bat it's very similar to a bourbon, almost a sour mash one.  It's sweet, it's hot, and it's a bit tannic from the oak.  The finish is warming and smooth.

Now I'm gonna water this down.  My drink, my rules.  No science, just a few drops from the filter. Okay! THERE'S that maple!  Now we've got a much sweeter blend that lets you taste some sugar, almonds, and the French oak influence (it's darker and has no vanilla unlike American oak).  The finish still has a little heat but a great sugary aftertaste.  This rum almost tastes like a spiced rum, albeit a very high quality one.  There's a lot going on and it's hard to pick out individual notes but overall it's very tasty.

I've only had this rum straight but I may get bold and mix a little sugar Pepsi in and see how it does.


We will be purchasing more bottles as funds allow.  I was lucky enough to be gifted this by my sister for Christmas.  Local prices (TN) are $35 which is $5 cheaper than the regular 24.",5,2016-01-08 09:12:12

Bearowolf,41nvx3,3,rum,"Any suggestions for good, cheap, low carb/sugar rum?","In an effort to lose weight I started a ketogenic diet and I've had to give up beer for a while, and of the low carb spirits, rum is my favorite. Back when I was a poor college student I was mostly a ""biggest bang for your buck"" kind of guy, and usually would pick up a 1.75L that was around $20. Now I'm a poor college graduate, so I can't exactly go dropping a lot of cash on the fancy stuff. The more things change, the more they stay the same, huh?

I was hoping /r/rum could recommend me some good budget rum that could fit into my diet. Most of the stuff I buy now gets mixed in with coke zero, mio water, or is used in pirate coffee, which is just a white russian that uses rum instead vodka. Occasionally I make mojitos.

I suspect you guys here are all rum connoisseurs but I was wondering if I could ask you about the mid range? 

I've just bought a bottle of [Doorly's 3 year white rum](https://www.masterofmalt.com/rum/doorlys/doorlys-3-year-old-rum/?srh=1) as the title would suggest.  It was recommended to me by my local spirit merchant as a good mid-range rum - a step up from Bacardi blanco superior while being modestly priced.  Here a bottle of the aforementioned Bacardi is about ¬£17.50, I paid ¬£22.50 for this rum and Kraken for example would be about ¬£20+.  I've not been able to find any reviews on  the Doorly's other than one or two shopping websites that just say ""7 out of 10 - its a good rum"".  Has anyone here tried it and would they recommend it?  It would be mostly for sours, mojitos, and other fruit based cocktails.",6,2015-12-09 00:01:18

Figured that I would provide some info here on rum in Montego Bay since I myself and others have asked about it previously.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to hit a grocery store or local shop to see what selection and prices were like.  I did visit the Shoppes at Rose Hall.  Two stores selling at heavily marked-up sticker prices($220US for Appleton 21-year LOL, $58 for 12-year).  They had some of the Edwin Charley offerings from $185 to $225. No foreign selection.  Prices negotiable but I didn't even bother.  Another tourist shop located below an Indian restaurant that my father-in-law visited also had heavily marked up but negotiable prices.

The Duty-free at Sangstar Airport was ok.  Extensive selection of cheap Jamaican rums and rum creams.  Lots of cheap Bacardi offerings.  Here are some of the highlights, though(all prices US, bottles 700mL/750mL unless otherwise idicated):

* Appleton 21-year $104
* Zacapa XO $100 or 2/179
* Zacapa 23 $79
* Smatt's Gold $45
* El Dorado 15 $44
* Royal Jamaican 10-year $40.  Also had gold and white but I don't recall the prices.
* Flor de Cana 18 $40
* Flor de Cana 12 $30
* Appleton 12-year 1L $33
* Bacardi 8-year 1L $30
* Matusalem Gran Reserva (unsure on price but I think high-30's.
* Havana Club something.  Sorry but I don't recall what it was or how much.


I came home with a bottle of Blackwell from my father-in-law, and decided to take a chance on the Smatt's over the Royal Jamaican 10-year. I didn't know much about either one.",6,2015-12-15 00:27:57

thelonecaner,3xxa34,4,rum,"What should qualify a rum to be ""Super Premium""?","I'm throwing this question out for general input.  The moniker ""Super Premium"" rum has been thrown about in the last year or two, but nowhere has it been defined what that actually means.  I'd like to know what drinkers think.

So: in your opinion, is ""Super Premium"" based on

[1] Price

[2] Age in barrels

[3] Rarity (i.e., how few bottles made)

[4] How long ago it was bottled (e.g. 1965) irrespective of true ageing

[5] Uniqueness (a special, once-only bottling)

[6] All or some of the above

[7] Some other criterion (like...?)

This won't change what marketers do in the slightest, but at least we can see get a sense of what the buying public feels. And I'm curious myself.

Rum aficionados of Reddit, for many years my family has been plagued by a mystery. One with which I hope you can help.

First of all, my father's mother was a badass. Born in Yugoslavia, she escaped with her family to the US in the 40s, losing a brother to starvation along the way. She remains to this day the only person I know to have been shot from an aircraft-mounted machine gun. Unfortunately, we lost her to cancer years ago, and the world lost a great baker.

She made rum cake that would make your mouth sing, and nut cookies that broke your heart as you choked on powdered sugar. 

Instrumental to most of her more memorable recipes was a medium sized, cheaply made bottle stored in a dusty, dark, forgotten corner of the house brought to the States after a trip to her homeland in the 80s. Labeled ""Favorit Inlander Rum 80%"", this magic elixir infused pastry, cake, and cookie alike with a buttery smooth rum flavor that left you contemplating how pale and flavorless your experiences with other baked goods would forever after be. 

After she passed, the bottle was carefully hoarded, like a miser counting coin. A tablespoon for a birthday cake, a teaspoon for cookies, a drop to flavor fudge, it was more precious than gold. Like all good things, though, years later the supply ran out.  

Now in my mid 20s, with aging parents, aunts, and uncles, I would like to do something for those who have done so much for me. I want to find the ingredient in so many family memories.

I now request a favor from anyone who might have knowledge of Austrian Inlander rums. Please help me find this rum.




The bottle is marked as below:

Sir-Cthulhu,3tihul,6,rum,"Fell in love with rum, but now I need to take it further","Hello guys !

I recently started to drink rum, mostly because I don't like beer. At first, it was rum and coke, but it soon became simply rum. I found that I'd rather drink it neat than mix it with anything else. So far, I've only drank spiced Captain Morgan rum. Now, I'm looking to explore a little bit. I've read some posts here and the sidebar as well, but I couldn't really find many things that suited me well. Some of the propositions I found were not available in my area or were not in my price range.

If you wonder what I have access to, it's fairly simple. All alcohol is sold by the ""SAQ"", in Quebec, and [these are the rums that they have](http://www.saq.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchDisplay?orderBy=1&amp;originalSearchTerm=*&amp;categoryIdentifier=0507&amp;beginIndex=0&amp;showOnly=product&amp;langId=-1&amp;triOrdre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saq.com%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2FAjaxProduitSearchResultView%3FfacetSelectionCommandName%3DSearchDisplay&amp;metaData=&amp;pageSize=20&amp;searchTerm=*&amp;pageView=grid&amp;catalogId=50000&amp;facet=adi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22%7Cadi_f9%3A%221%22&amp;categoryId=39973&amp;storeId=20002&amp;orderByType=1)

I'll admit that I'm tempted by the Kraken Black rum, the review I found seemed good and I was interested in getting a bottle. And it's cheap.

Considering my budget that would be about $35 for a 750ml bottle, do you have any sipping rums suggestions ?

ethanGeltan,3tiy1y,10,rum,My recent adventure with rum-raisin pancakes!,"So, being a lover of both rum and baked goods, I have often made and enjoyed rum-raisin desserts. Yesterday I was having a bit of a craving, but didn't want to wait the time it would take to make a proper cake or something.

But pancakes are quick and easy right? And I bet they'd taste good with rum and raisins (spoilers, they do). So I decided to make some for dinner (that bachelor lifestyle).

So I made a quick batch of pancake batter, put in about 2 or 3 oz of Flor de Cana I had lying around, and some raisins, and made pancakes. I also had some mango simple syrup (simple syrup + Bacardi mango) from last weekend, I figured that would be a good topping, so a few splashes of that go on my stack of 3 pancakes. Dinner is served!

It turns out that since most baked goods are cooked for 30-90 minutes, the alcohol evaporates and leaves just the flavor. Pancakes cook for about 5 minutes. The rum stays in. I discover this most of the way through pancake \#2.

Now, it was at most 3oz of rum, and eaten alongside 3 hearty pancakes (on an otherwise empty stomach), so I didn't get drunk, but still quite a bit above tipsy.

And that was my wednesday night.

Pros - Pancakes, which taste like rum, and get you drunk. Possibly the greatest discovery of my life. 10/10.

Cons - Wednesday night, work in the morning. I don't drink on weeknights, ever. 7/10

Do with this information as you will fellow rumittors.",2,2015-11-20 12:00:43

As for the Wray &amp; Nephew, Jamaica's independence was in 1962, so that places the bottle from 1987.

RootsmanSam,3ogwwd,13,rum,Suggestion for sipping rum &amp; rum coke,"Hello everyone,

been a lurker for a while now but t I thought it was time to ask some advice to the veterans. I discovered the world of rum through rum &amp; coke and i still love it to this day. In the beginning I drank my rum&amp;coke with plain bacardi white. Right now I prefer this mixer with the darker bacardi rums or with kraken but I would love to hear some rum suggestions that make a killer rum&amp;coke. Suggestions can also be spiced rum. I don't really like captain morgan with coke...

Second, and for you guys maybe more interesting, since a couple of months I really love to sip rum straight also but i'm still quite the noob. I've read some posts here, some rum blogs but nothing beats a personal suggestion hence my post.


So far there are 3 rums I really love to sip neat:

- Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, perfect rum to sip neat for me, could drink it daily! any recommendations for rums around that palate, most definetely welcome!

- Appleton 12 , a bit harsher for me then the diplomatico but really dig this one too. Is it worth saving up for a higher end appleton? 

- Plantation XO. Got this one gifted as a house warming present. Haven't drank alot of it since it's the most expensive bottle I have but love this one very much too!

I've tried other rums like dictador 12 (very strange taste, not really my thing) , El dorado 12 (tastes a bit like whiskey to me, fro mtime to time also a bit harsh afterburn) , Appleton 5 (bit too harsh also). 

So.... I hope you can give me some good suggestions with these info. I'm from Europe, price range preferably not too expensive but i can splash a bit for a bottle if it's really good. 

thanks in advance!",28,2015-10-13 00:41:11
thebeardedchild,3om97t,12,rum,What should I start with?,"I decided I want to get into rum, and I'm wondering if you guys can help me get started?

In my limited experience, I thought I've liked Myer's Dark Rum and Kraken, but in some brief research here I've found those aren't typically recommended very highly. Although I think I'd like to start with darker rums, if that's a thing.

I got into whiskey/bourbon recently, and found I've liked Rye the most. A few brands I liked are Templetons, George Dickel and Bulleit. I liked the price of the latter two for still being quality whiskeys.  

I like beer a ton and drink pretty much anything. Love IPAs, Imperial Stouts, Quads and Dubbels the most I'd say.

Anyway I figure I'd give my desired flavor profiles for other things, so hopefully that can help anyone narrow down what I might wanna start with!! Preferably something with a good quality to price ratio like Bulleit or Dickel, but I'm open to anything if it's gonna be a solid buy. Thanks!!",14,2015-10-14 02:29:51

bridges12791,3p2afb,7,rum,Review: Centenario 5 year. Costa Rica.,"My first real review, so go easy on me fellas:

First a small story.  I studied abroad in Costa Rica a year ago.  This is when i began drinking aged rum.  Before I left, I brought a few bottles of rum home to the States with me because my family said they didn't find it in the stores.  So I've not drank anything I brought home because I never found it in stores.  Now I live in Miami, FL and found Centenario on the shelves.  So, now I can drink what I have!!  I also have the 12 year and will review at a later date if this one goes well.

This is a 350 mL bottle, it was 7000 Costa Rican Colones which is about US$13 or so.  The store here in Miami has the more common 7 year at about $35 for 750 mL.  

Review: I'm drinking it neat. 

This rum is quite spicy for an aged rum.  I was pretty taken off guard actually.  The 7 which i had over a year ago, I remember being much smoother and sweeter. 

It begins, as I said, earthy, spicy.  It lingers with a bitterness.  I actually do not get the sweet notes from the molasses anywhere in the profile.  I'm typically a bourbon drinker, so I tend to pick up sweetness of rum immediately. I'm actually rather disappointed.  

The 7 was delicious. Since I came back to the States, I've had some Bacardi rums (gold, and another I don't remember) that were also very good.  

3 out of 5.  Hopefully the 12 year will be better at a later date. ",7,2015-10-17 09:23:33

amazingD,3pe67d,2,rum,Quality question,"I discovered a few years ago (unintentionally) that I enjoy mixing rum with egg nog rather than brandy. Unfortunately 21-year-old-me had a lot less money and a lot lower standards than today-me and I have used Bacardi rum for the last several Christmases. I don't dislike Bacardi but I know there are far better rums out there. Which would be, in your opinion, the best to mix with egg nog?

So I have tracked down a supplier in the states that is willing to ship this rum to the UK For me, but it is not cheap. The price per bottle is $24.99 but the sting is the postage; this ranges from $69 for one bottle upwards to $254 for 12 bottles. $69 is too expensive for one bottle but if we club together I can run a group purchase. I will want 2 bottles and suspect my friend will too so there will be 8 slots on this split, with each bottle costing a total of ¬£29.85 ($46.15 total, from $21.16 per bottle delivery and $24.99 for the bottle) and probably a quid or so for the conversion charge. We'd need a gentleman agreement that we split any import charges equally as they are never guaranteed. Is anyone interested?",4,2015-10-21 01:10:42

ErgoSalvator,3q6f0b,7,rum,Getting into good rum...,"Before yesterday, all I'd ever had were the likes of Bacardi 151 (which I use as cleaning solvent) and various memories of slugging down a shot of Captain Morgan or Admiral Nelson in college. 


Since my college days, I've become a little more discriminating in my spirits intake, and have what might be called an advanced collection of single malt scotch and bourbon, and a decent collection of cognac. I wanted to see what rum had to offer. 


I bought a bottle of Pusser's (blue 43%) and a bottle of Ron Zacapa 23. Conclusion: the Zacapa is nice, but strikes me as kind of boring. It's sweet and inoffensive but not really very interesting to me, at least not yet. The Pusser's is great stuff. I love its strong flavor and burn. In light of this, what should I try next? I'm open to suggestions of things similar to Pusser's, and things totally different from both. 


Tl;Dr: whiskey drinker likes Pusser's and finds Zacapa 23 not anything to write home about. Suggestions? ",14,2015-10-26 02:40:54

Now, as a 'grown up', I don't usually go in for mixing my rum, but once in a blue moon ill make one like dad - it always tastes like nostalgia, and not the fake kind that a 19 year old can get by buying an 8-bit Mario ball cap.

So I'm diving into the selection of whiskies (typically my go to) when the bartender offers a taste from a small glass he poured. He tells me it's a Rum that undergoes an aging in wine barrels (i believe sherry but possibly cabernet) and finishes in a whiskey barrel. It was fantastic and I've had nothing but trouble trying to remember the name and track it down. Hopefully this isn't too vague for the community here to provide some insight. All help is appreciated. I'll also state that the bottle was clear, kind of stubby, and had a rather plain white label with some script writing on it. Thanks!",3,2015-10-28 21:09:24

jdvrider,3quvd1,6,rum,Suggestions for new collection of rums on the sweeter side,"Hey all, just discovered this sub recently. By chance last year wanting to try something different I grabbed a bottle of Diplomatico Reserva (orange label, not Exclusiva) and loved it. Then I picked up a bottle of Pyrat XO, it's okay but I'm using it as a mixer. I have friends who are scotch or bourbon snobs but I haven't really been able to get into either one so I decided I'm going to start putting together a decent collection of rums to do something a little different.

Unfortunately out here in the Arizona desert our distributors seem to be lacking, Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva isn't even carried anywhere, let alone most El Dorado, Flor de Cana, or anything above the cheapest Appleton. I have seen Zacapa 23 but that's it for nicer rum. On the plus side I'm taking a road trip to Southern California soon and will be able to stop at some places with a much better selection.

I do prefer the somewhat sweet rums, I've been trying to cut most sugars out of my diet so having a sweet spirit makes it a little more of a treat. I also don't drink significant volume so I don't mind spending on nicer things, they'll last me a long time.

Right now I'm thinking of spending up to $200 or so in total, the first few are pretty much locked in because I feel like they need to be in my collection based on feedback I've read here and other sites and I think they'll be the type of rum I like.

 - Diplomatico Reserva Excusiva
 - El Dorado 12
 - Plantation XO 20th

Beyond that I could either get 2-3 other cheaper to midrange bottles, or go all in on a bottle of Diplomatico 2000 Single Vintage. 

I'm open to other suggestions I might want to consider and it doesn't hurt to either have a backup plan if something isn't available or add it to my wishlist for future purchases. Thanks!",11,2015-10-31 00:36:02

I used to be able to find this rum pretty regularly but over the past few years it has disappeared off the shelves. Is this rum no longer being produced or maybe just no longer imported into the US? I found a few online stores as a last resort but would rather not get killed on shipping.

This was the first aged rum that really turned me on to rum. I must have half a dozen of the leather bags that are part of the bottle packaging around my house.

1) Zacapa 23
2) Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva 
(these are both the same price at around $40)
3) Zacapa XO (bit of a splurge at $80 but I've read great things about it)

panzerdarling,3h8kjf,2,rum,Dark Rum exploration,"Hey all, so I've been slowly touring dark rums alongside my usual drinking, but I'm prone to just mentally glossing over possibilities.

So far I've gone through

* El Dorado Dark, probably my favorite dark for its sweet guyanan sugar.

* Plantation Original Dark, a nice rum but a little light to stand up to some of the expected uses of dark rums (ginger beer). 

* Goslings, the benchmark, though it's been a while. This is on my rebuy list already to remind myself of it.

* Cruzan Blackstrap, kinda overpowering in its single note, but a solid molasses fountain for a remarkable price.

* Lemon Hart, my life, my love, my soul. Taken from me and not yet returned. 

Ed Hamilton's LH replacement is not available to me, and I can't find it anywhere that will ship to Minnesota, same with remaining stocks of LH. I already called up the listed distributor in MN for Ed's bottling company and they said it's been off their books for a while if they ever actually got a case.

So, am I forgetting anything you all think are worth tries? There are a couple of local distillers that make rum from Iowa and MN, but none are oriented towards truly dark style rums, so really looking towards national brands.

Thanks!",14,2015-08-17 04:56:11

dpf22,3diw86,8,rum,Need advice selecting a groomsmen gift,"My wedding is coming up in a few weeks and one of my groomsmen is a lover of El Dorado. I believe he's tried the 12, 15 and 21-year old stuff already and has loved all of them. I was hoping to get him something he hasn't tried yet so my mind immediately went to the 25 year old vintage...easy right? Not at $400+ a bottle!


I'm wondering if there is something that would be similar to El Dorado in the price range of $75-125 CAD. And with that, I'm in eastern Canada and my selection may be somewhat limited.

ilovescotch93,3dllmc,6,rum,Rums similar to Old Monk.,"So my dad's birthday is coming up. He's a diehard Old Monk fan, and I have to admit, it's a really awesome rum. I'm looking for a rum in a similar style to get him as a present.


So basically, I'm looking for an aged rum that is dry to only moderately sweet, with lots of deep oak and pungent spice notes (my mouth is watering) and a good viscosity to it. Higher proof is always better of course, since you get a less watered down and better tasting spirit. I'm more of a single malt Scotch guy and am not as knowledgeable about rum, so any suggestions would be appreciated. 


Thanks!",4,2015-07-17 14:58:14

Jwalla83,3ememi,1,rum,What are your TOP 3 sipping rums?,"I've just recently entered the world of ""fancy"" rum, and I'm in heaven. I started with [Zafra Master Reserve](http://www.liquorama.biz/images/com_hikashop/upload/zafra-21year.jpg) and [El Dorado 15yr](https://img.thewhiskyexchange.com/540/rum_eld2.jpg). Then I tried [Flor de Cana 4](https://img.thewhiskyexchange.com/540/rum_flo2.jpg) and [Flor de Cana 7](http://www.spirituosen-superbillig.com/pic/Flor-de-Cana-7-years-Grand-Reserve-1-liter.5385a.jpg) (both really well-priced for the quality), as well as [Appleton Estate Extra 12yr](http://www.refinedvices.com/newsimages/rum/appletonestateextra.jpg). Finally, I just took a vacation to the Caribbean where I found a Rare Rum Bar (be still my beating heart) and I had the immense pleasure of tasting both the [Ron Zacapa XO](http://therumhowlerblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/ron-zacapa-xo-25-e1346096375325.jpg?w=300&amp;h=376) and the [El Dorado 25 year](http://thefloatingrumshack.com/content/images/el-dorado/el-dorado-25yo-bottle.jpg) -- mother of GOD is that a good rum.

I can say, without hesitation, that my (albeit somewhat limited) list is:

1. **El Dorado 25** - This was just the absolute pinnacle of rum for me. Just perfection. I sipped it neat and it was pure bliss the entire way through. At $50/shot it should be, but it was *more* than worth every penny.

2. **Ron Zacapa XO** - I drank this alongside the El Dorado 25, although it was ""only"" $20/shot, which probably wasn't fair because the El Dorado is just something else. But the Ron Zacapa XO was also incredible (and at a much lower price point compared to the El Dorado -- $100 compared to $500 for my area). Very flavorful and interesting. I plan to buy a bottle of this for my birthday next month.

3. **El Dorado 15** - Maybe I'm just a sucker for the El Dorado line, but this was a wonderful purchase at $40. It was my first ""big-boy"" rum to own, so it took one or two tastings to really appreciate it, but man - once I got used to it, it was incredible. I usually drank it on the rocks or mixed with either Coke or Dr. Pepper (I know that may sound like blasphemy, but I just *loved* the taste combo). Really great rum and I highly recommend this for anyone interested in getting started with sipping rums -- it may take you a tasting or two to get used to it (like I did) but at only $40 it's a steal. Excellent quality, and wonderful alone or mixed.

DistinguishedSpirits,3ev68m,6,rum,Bacardi Cocktail - Possibly the only way to improve a Daiquiri.,"How to make the Bacardi Cocktail:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoDU_wrQQWk


This is the Trader Vic's 1947 Bartender's Manual, which was most certainly the recipe that Bond would have been ordering in the book set in 1951 (published in 1953). However, there was an earlier recipe circa 1910 that was an entirely different drink, one that was closer to a Martini made with Rum.

James Bond never drank a Bacardi Cocktail in the books, but he did insist on ordering one for Vesper Lynd‚Äîthe person whom the [Vesper Cocktail](https://youtu.be/a6gHAnUSMGo) is named after‚Äîwhen he first met her in Casino Royale. Bond probably considered the drink fitting for a woman because of its color. But he later learned, after getting to know Vesper, that she would also be just as happy drinking straight, chilled Vodka.

I, however, would much prefer a Bacardi Cocktail to straight Vodka. It's like a Daiquiri taken to the next level. In fact, I'd rather have a Bacardi Cocktail than a Daiquiri, as the addition of the [Grenadine](https://youtu.be/4e2xNt385H4) adds so much extra depth to the drink.

Make sure you use homemade Grenadine. It's not hard to make, but it makes a world of difference. Also, you're going to always be better off squeezing fresh citrus juice. I like to squeeze, strain and bottle it before I make a drink, that way I can measure it precisely.

And like the [Dark 'n Stormy](https://youtu.be/gKBToDEMTsQ), the Bacardi Cocktail is a registered trademark, so you have to make it with Bacardi. If you use another Rum, you'll have to call it something else, because that's what you just made. Enjoy!



Recipe:

1.5 oz Rum

0.5 oz Lime Juice

0.25 oz Grenadine

Shake with ice. Strain into chilled coupe glass. Spare the garnish.",18,2015-07-28 13:32:22

SaucyPots,38fge8,3,rum,Question about Plummer and Wedderburn style rums,"I was just reminded when thinking about Smith &amp; Cross of something I heard Ed Hamilton say once during an interview on K&amp;L's short-lived Spirits Journal Podcast (Episode 20 around 33:38), to wit: 

""[Smith &amp; Cross] was designed to be aged much longer than it is and then blended in small amounts with other products...Up until just recently all of the production from that distillery was shipped to Europe, aged, and then blended into other rum products.""

We know S&amp;C to be a roughly equal parts mixture of ~6-month old Wedderburn and 1.5-3 year old Plummer rums.

My question is: How old (according to Mr. Hamilton) should Plummer and Wedderburn rums be? Of course, this will change based on whether they're aged in the Caribbean or on Mainland Europe, but do we have concrete historical precedent? And then any notions what a typical blending recipe would have been?

Thanks all - enjoy a safe and rummy weekend.

Not one mention other than a single post on this subreddit that didn't really answer any questions. When I google it pictures of Kraken come up... It looks very similar to Kraken. I ask because my Fry's Grocery just set up a display (yes, this mysterious bottle has its own display) of the stuff, running some deal where if you buy a bottle you get a free 2 liter of coke.

It's bottled at 46% ABV, is labeled as having 'added sugar, caramel coloring, and other flavors'. As a whisky guy I don't know much about rum, but is that normal for a rum? Also as a whisky guy, I do enjoy that they are upfront about their additives, that's rather refreshing. One last bit of concern, there is a light sediment (stringy, sticks together) at the bottom of the bottle. Does this mean that it has been sitting for a while and extra sugar is just separating out? Or that it wasn't chill filtered and these are some sort of lipids? So, /r/rum, at the wee price of $15, is it worth the gamble to purchase this?",7,2015-06-27 07:59:55

knutliott,34vuv7,5,rum,results from the birthday party rum tasting,"My wife's party was a great success, in part thanks to this sub reddit.  The info here was key to selecting the best rums for her and her girlfriends to enjoy!

&amp;nbsp;

Here's their ranking:  
Ron Zacapa solera 23  
Angostura 1824  
El Dorado 21  
Appleton Estate 21  
Clement 10 (French, Martinique)  
Mount Gay 1703 (English, Barbados)  
Pusser's Nelson's Blood 15 (Navy, Tortola)

&amp;nbsp;

I also got the chance to taste through the rums and more-or-less agree with their rankings.  I would put the Angostura first, and might put the El Dorado second, but that's it.  
A few things surprised me based on what I'd read here.  First was the performance of the Mount Gay 1703 - I really expected it to be in the running, but it just seemed lackluster compared to the rest of the lineup.  It out-ranked the Pusser's only because the Pusser's just tasted weird to everyone.  Though to its credit, several people laughed and said ""yes that tastes like something a sailor would like!""  
Everyone liked the flavor of the Clement, but thought it was rather hot compared to the others.  I'm guessing that's due to its (lack of) age compared to the rest?  The Pusser's was also more spirity than the others which contributes to my suspicion.  
On the good end, the El Dorado was easily the smoothest and most subtle.  I suspect that worked against it in the voting as it didn't really stand out flavor-wise.  The Angostura has just a hint of the Angostura bitters aroma, which was very fun.  But the Zacapa ultimately edged it out by being rich and flavorful while still being mellow enough for even a bunch of novices to sip.  
We now have some great rum left over for drinks this summer!",8,2015-05-05 08:00:52

panzerdarling,35g6mn,11,rum,A word of advice on Angostura 5 and 7 years,"The 7 year is worth the $2 more it usually costs to buy it. The 5 year is not quite sipping worthy and unless the 7 year's darker and woodier flavor is somehow going to seriously disrupt a cocktail's balance that you need gold rum for, you're better off getting it.

Likewise, the 5 year is not good enough as a mixed drink component for its money - Flor de Cana 4 year or Doorly's if you can find it is a better bang for your buck, Appleton V/X or even Appleton Special is a better flavor.

Unless those $2-3 are the key to getting some mexican coke you couldn't possibly afford otherwise, get the 7 year. 5 is an unfortunate comrpomise that doesn't live up to its sibling for flavor to price ratio.

Don't get me wrong though, it's an excellent rum, and we are talking differences of $2-5, so if you truly love the Angostura style, please ignore my tipsy ass. ",2,2015-05-10 09:12:37

wlphoenix,360qn4,2,rum,On the hunt for the perfect dark rum,"**Backstory:** So after trying a number of the dark rums that are on the US market, I've come to the conclusion that none of them fit the exact flavor profile I'm looking for. They're either too sweet or too gasoline-y to do what I want. So I'm looking to blend my own house rum to fit the profile I want.

**Goal:** I want a dark rum that is fairly dry and leans more toward molasses than burnt sugar. I want it to have a bit of funk, but not nearly as much as Smith &amp; Cross. I need it to be an anchor in cocktails, but I don't expect it to fit every role a dark rum could fill in a cocktail.

**Baselines:** These are the rums I've tried that I would consider using as a ""dark rum"" in a cocktail, along with my comments on them.

* **Blackwell Black Gold** - As close to perfect as I've found. A little sweet and a touch more vanilla than I'd like, but the real problem is distribution. There's nowhere I can buy this within 8 hrs.
* **Samaroli 1988** - At $47 a pour, it's sacrilege I'd even list this as a mixing rum, and yet it has so many of the things I want. Dry but flavorful, with unique notes I can't find elsewhere (cherry/oak/vanilla)
* **Appleton Extra 12yr** - I love the dryness and the profile, but I'd like to swap out some of the oakiness for molasses
* **Cruzan Blackstrap** - A sugar bomb, but the molasses is fantastic. Great as a float, but less as a base 
* **El Dorado 15yr** - Now this is closer to the dry vs molasses I want, but it's a bit pricey for a mixer
* **Cruzan Diamond Estate 5yr** - Honestly the best base for the price I've found. Not extraordinary, but not shabby at all
* **Smith &amp; Cross** - Great rum, but way too funky to use as a go-to in cocktails that aren't made for it. I get more banana than sugar
* **Gosling's Black Seal** - Molasses and ethanol
* **Myer's Dark** - Just ethanol

**Un-tried:** The rums I want to try, but haven't found locally.

* **Coruba**
* **Scarlet Ibis**

**Current Test:**

* 5 parts Appleton 12yr
* 2 parts Rhum Barbancourt 8yr
* 1 part Cruzan Blackstrap

Good dry vs molasses, but it could use a bit more funkyness. Next iterations will either try a younger French rum, or will sub out 1/4 oz of Appleton 12yr for S&amp;C. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions or opinions. I'd also love to hear what you think is the best dark rum on the market, or if you've tried blending your own rums.

EDIT: 

Settled on this:

* 4 parts Appleton 12
* 2 parts Rhum Barbancourt 4yr
* 1 part Cruzan Blackstrap
* 1 part Smith &amp; Cross

Is the syrup only version completely substitutable with Velvet Falernum in recipes?  None of them seem to specify one or the other.  Also, I notice the Velvet Falernum doesn't contain any ginger which seems to be a big component of the homemade stuff.

**Journal Entry #2: 5/16/15**

----------------

4/23/15 @ 12PM: Started aging two liters of JW&amp;N overproof white rum in smoked oak barrel. JW&amp;N is a very flavorful white rum, tastes like sugarcane with floral notes, sweet and tangy.

4/28/15 @ 11PM: Color is light gold. Flavor is sweet and tangy with first notes of smoke and wood. Strength is really a punch in the face.

4/30/15 @ 8PM: Color remains light gold. Still very sweet with slightly stronger notes of wood and smoke.

5/2/15 @ 1:30PM: Color has gotten slightly more dark gold. Flavor is noticable smoother, still sweet but less tangy.

5/3/15 @ 10PM: Slightly bolder flavor but still not ready. Maybe one more week.

5/5/15 @ 8PM: Bold golden color. Oaky flavors progression is accelerating faster between tastings. Almost there!

5/10/15 @ 10AM: Dark gold color with deep shade of red. Strong wood flavor with notes of smoke. Not sweet but not dry. Nice nose. Suprisingly strong ABV retained. FINISHED!

------------------

The rum aging process was a lot of fun, if nothing else it was a good excuse to drink rum every day! I'm very happy with how the rum turned out but I am not done yet. Next step, flavoring! I have already started this next step so I will be updating you guys with Journal Entry #3 very soon!

- Zaya- sweet.  
- Ron Zacapa 23 ( unbelievable)  I love that unique taste.. not sure what it is..
- Pusser's -  good stuff, def. more akin to the bourbon that the other three.

So.. right now my local liquor store has :

- El Dorado 12 
- El Dorado 21

I've got a bottle of Chairman's reserve spiced but I find it tastes like medicine. Compared to the banana and cinnamon nose and taste of the El Dorado spiced - the chairmans reserve is rather foul.
If you guys have any suggestions of rums in the mid price range, that in some way rival the more expensive aged rums that you enjoy neat, I would really appreciate it.

ArtDSellers,32tefn,6,rum,Just opened up some of my agricole.,"So, I was just in Guadeloupe over New Years.  While there, my wife and I would enjoy a ti punch every night for the sunset, and we reeealy grew to like the standard Rhum Bologne blanc.  Just wonderful with some sugar and lime.

Anyway, we brought back quite a bit of rhum, to include a bottle of the Bologne blanc.  We've been reluctant to open any of that rhum, since it's next to impossible to get here in the states - we really want it to last.  We finally opened up the Bologne last night, and my goodness... it's just wonderful.  We made a couple of ti punches with some fresh-squeezed lime and some Marie Galante cane sugar.  It was like being back on the dock watching the sunset.  That grassy aftertaste gets widdled away by the lime just enough, and the strength of the rhum really lets you know, without being too much.  I can't recommend agricole enough... once you get the taste for it, just wonderful.

Man do I hope we start getting some French West Indian agricoles here in the states sometime soon... it's just too bad that this whole branch of wonderful rhums remains so unavailable to us.",7,2015-04-16 23:50:12

The_Rum_Pirate,33mwtt,14,rum,Journal Entry #1: Soaking the barrel &amp; filling it with rum!,"Hello /r/rum my name is /u/The_Rum_Pirate and I will be documenting my experiance here aging and flavoring small batches of rum on my boat in the Virgin Islands.


**Journal Entry #1: 4/23/15**


After receiving my [two liter oak barrel](http://oakbarrelsltd.com/2-liter-oak-barrel-with-black-steel-hoops.html) in the mail the first step was to soak it in water for one week. The barrel was hand made without any glues or sealers so it was initially quite leaky and needed to be fully submerged. After 24 hours of submergen the oak swelled to become water tight and was able to hold water on its own for the next six days.


The reason for this initial soak is two fold. The first reason is to swell the wood so that none of my precious rum leaks out. The second reason is to remove some of the harsh tannins from the wood. Small barrels already have a higher surface area of oak to rum so it would be easy to over flavor my batch if im not careful.


Next I drained the (now brown) water from the two liter barrel and replaced it with [two bottles of Jay Wright &amp; Nephew overproof white rum](http://oi62.tinypic.com/1zoazrs.jpg). *Fun Fact: JW&amp;N accounts for 90% of the rum consumed in Jamaica!* The reason I picked JW&amp;N is mostly because I love the tangy flavor but also because it's cheap and being 126 proof will help keep the rum strong after losing the angles share (alcohol lost to evaporation during the aging).


Finally I corked the barrel, taped my notes to it, and [stashed it away in the bilge](http://oi60.tinypic.com/10o3fi8.jpg) to age at sea. Just like the original Caribbean rums, mine will rock slowly under the floorboards of a sailboat as it absorbs the oaky smoke flavors from its barrel :)


Stay tuned for my tasting notes as the rum ages, and later for the process of flavoring and bottling the final product! Let me know in the comments if you would like to subscribe and I will tag you in future updates:

NotSoSlenderMan,2ybeh5,10,rum,The worst rum you have ever had?,"So I would like to say that I am not at all versed in rums. All of them that I have tried so far have not been amazing spirits and only a few have been barely passable as sippable.

I decided to buy something because I had not drank since the Superbowl. I went for something new because I am trying to expand my tastes(which is not really possible with the cheap stuff I buy). So I picked up a bottle of Sammy's Beach Bar Rum because of the Hawaii buzzword and the slender bottle. I did not find out until later that it was a rum created by/for Sammy Hagar. Which is coincidence and possibly ironic(in the *very* loose sense of the word) I previously bought Blue Chair Bay, which is a Kenny Chesney endorsed/produced rum.

Anyways, wow. I consider this stuff **bad**. It smells awful and is horrendously tasting. I have no idea why other than the obvious that it is differently made... If this had been the first rum I had tried I would not have tried rum again.

So I guess I want to ask what is the worst tasting rum you have ever had?",42,2015-03-08 14:26:38

Starting with an overproof white rum (maybe JW&amp;N) I will age my base rum in a [2 liter oak cask](http://oakbarrelsltd.com/2-liter-oak-barrel-with-black-steel-hoops.html) for about a month to taste. It is my understanding that because the small barrels create a higher surface area per liter ratio it does not take nearly as long to age the rum. Does anyone have experience with this?


After aging, the base rum will be put into various mason jars for flavoring and then strained into small bottles for storage. I have come up with a few recipes to try, but I could really use some guidance on quantities of ingredients and soaking times or else it will be all trial and error trying to figure it out. Here's what I'm thinking:

**Dark Rum** (Best enjoyed in a Cubra Libra)

*-carmalized sugar (most)*

*-mollasis*

*-vanilla bean*


**Spiced Ginger Rum** (Best enjoyed in a Dark and Stormy)

*-carmalized sugar (least)*

*-ground ginger*

*-cinnamon (light)*

*-clove (light)*

*-allspice (light)*


**Citrus Rum** (best enjoyed in a Rum Tonic)

*-cut with unaged JWN*

*-lime zest*

*-orange zest*

*-rosewater*

*-orange blossom water*

00TylerDurden00,2zvybx,15,rum,So I took a trip to New Zealand and came back with a bottle of rum.,"I found myself in New Zealand in December and January (visited all over the South Island and Wellington, definitely recommend), and during my time in Wellington, I found a small bar called [Crumpet](https://foursquare.com/v/crumpet/4f6441b6e4b04d4b1566f2ab). I struck up a conversation with the bartender (whom was extremely knowledgeable and made great drinks), about local New Zealand spirits. He recommended I try [Smoke and Oakum's Gunpowder Rum](https://sites.google.com/site/gunpowderrum/home), made right there in Wellington, New Zealand. I have never had anything like it. 
&gt;A blend of rums is flavored with peppers, calumet  ‚Äòtobacco‚Äô (a tobacco substitute smoked by Native Americans), and traditional black gunpowder before being hand-bottled with a final flavoring ingredient that gives the appearance of gunpowder grains lying at the bottom of the bottle. The rum is presented in a variety of bottle-shapes which references early rum-making practices of the 17th and 18th centuries when any old bottle would be used (Gosling‚Äôs Black Seal rum, for instance, reused empty champagne bottles in the early days of its production, which were then sealed with black wax ‚Äì hence the name).

I ended up buying a bottle, and I brought it back with me to Texas. I had not been much into spirits before I went on the trip, and this was one of the first rums I've had that wasn't mixed in with Coca Cola. I find that it gets mixed reviews among people who have tried it. Some (like myself) find it interesting and complex, and others can't stand it. I really don't know what to think about it, and I was wondering if anyone else has tried this rum before? Are there similar rums that I can compare it to here in the US? Any and all help would be appreciated.

TL;DR I got a bottle of rum I like, and I don't know if there are other rums like it.

Edit: Its not mass produced. I have bottle 2007.",7,2015-03-22 15:53:36

[deleted],2wn7m4,4,rum,El Dorado 21 Year,"Turned another year yesterday. My eldest brother surprised me with a ""surprise"" bottle. Wouldn't show me the actual bottle or tell me the type of booze. Prior to this, the only rum I'd had was cheap ass rum in college and the only ""drinkable"", depending on how you look at it, Pyrat XO. Being more of a single malt and tequila, and craft beer fella, the scent surprised me. It was a confusing scent between Hennessy XO and Martell's highest's offering that doesn't break the bank for a few years. Despite that, I was thinking it was a smokey malt with a *sweeter* finish. Upon tasting it honestly tasted like the XO, but with strong flavors of date, raisins and piloncillo. The last of which I adore because the sugar cane is so complex in flavor. 

After my second snifter, I had to ask what it was I was drinking because I wasn't quite sure. It was sweeter than XO but much, much smoother and tastier. I was surprised when I was told it was rum. The only rum I had my eyes on were Appleton Estate's and after seeing the prices of their better stock, I figured I'd rather spend the money on Macallan 18 or 21. 


4/5 stars. 

Best served lower than typical room temperature and letting the body temp do the work of picking up flavors as the alcohol warms up in the mouth. If it's too warm before drinking, the fumes can feel rough. Works well with dark chocolate, much like good cognac or a dry sparkling. I'll likely purchase the 21 and enjoy it alone on certain occasions. 


Bonus: Tried the next vintage blend in line as well. Very tasty, but sweeter than the 21. Would go well with a dark chocolate cake or vanilla ice cream. ",1,2015-02-21 18:02:27

What should I get once it runs out?,"Just grabbed a handle of Don Q Cristal, which I'd heard nothing but good things about, for about 20 bucks. Best I can say about it is it's inoffensive - certainly much better than Bacardi, but the flavor is really weak. It does work pretty well in a daiquiri, so I'll probably burn through it somewhat fast, but once it's done, I'd like to try something with a bit more character. As I've mentioned elsewhere, my liquor store has a terrible selection, but the brands they have that I recognize are Gosling's Black Seal, Kraken, Captain Morgan, Appleton, Don Q, and Bacardi. There's also a $13 dollar bottle of white rum called Rebellion small batch, which I couldn't find anything written about when I checked. 

Please keep recommendations under $15 - my store gouges pretty hard on anything that falls outside of the college-kid-party-drink menu, so I'll probably end up paying at least a 10% markup on anything that's actually decent.",6,2015-02-24 12:59:12

SpamBot_2,2x5xf4,4,rum,"Review: Libert√©, lidl's white rum","This is literally the cheapest rum I could find, and it has to be among the cheapest rum's you can find in the EU.
It's a 37,5% ABV white rum ""made in Germany"" according to the label, and 70cl cost me ‚Ç¨5,39 from a lidl in Italy.

***--- Appearance***

The bottle is quite nice: it has a tiny bulge near the neck, fairly simple white labels with mostly black writing and the name ""Libert√©"" in a big, red, cursive font, making this rum look somewhat classy.

The cocktails ideas listed on the back though are confusing to say the list - there's a cuba libre with lemon instead of lime for example.

***--- Smell***

At room temperature it has an alcohol smell, no more no less, mild but noticeable, with no other connotations I could discern; not a pleasant smell.
At around 5¬∞C it's odorless.

***--- Body***

Like water, but smoother.
A bit thin, definitely not oily.
Best way to describe it is thin water with an outside ""consistency"" resembling oil, in the sense that it's not thick but it's very smooth.

***--- Palate***

This rum has a very faint taste of spices, an even fainter taste of herbs and a somewhat noticeable taste of (veeery) roasted cocoa under a noticeable flavor of bad quality alcohol - it resembles a lot the unpleasant alcohol odor, and without paying much attention to it, say sipping it with the sole intention of getting drunk, at room temperature I would hardly discern any taste apart from the characteristic taste of cheap booze.
Watering it down a bit brings out the spices and herbs taste so I definitely recommend doing that.

***--- Finish***

It burns noticeably, and that is the only really thing worth noting.
The rest is a bitter and dry aftertaste of various burned ingredients - cocoa, chocolate, spices.
Watering it down reduces the bitterness quite a bit though.

***-- End of the story***

Libert√© isn't a good sipping rum.

It though looses the majority of its bad characteristics when you put it together with other ingredients to make cocktails or long drinks, and considering the price tag I'd recommend it for sure if you were searching for a very cheap, almost tasteless mixing rum.

I'm giving this a ***65 out of 100*** because of its convenience and ability to make for a decent mixing rum.",11,2015-02-26 06:32:38

I just want to create a rum review site which can be relied upon for it's honesty rather than who sends the reviewer the most samples.......

I'm trying to get the site more readers.  Believe it or not this subreddit forum on Rum is without doubt the most active forum on Rum I have found on the net. 

Unlike some other forum's it isn't full of know it all's or rum snob's just normal people.

So what I suppose I would like to know is what do you folks look for in a rum review site?  What engages and interests you all?

What would you like to see? What would draw you into viewing a particular site.

Any feedback will greatly appreciated.  From what I've noted so far I think I need to try and get a few US Domestic rums reviewed, the problem I will have is getting them!

It caught me off guard too since it is an overproof rum and has tits plastered on the label, everything about the marketing suggests it's going to be a nasty, stringent bottle of rum only meant to get college kids drunk but I promise you it's much better than that. I'm still new to rum and don't have the palette to give a full review, but it has a really nice fresh fruit / vegetal taste without the harsh alcohol taste you usually get younger rums. The only problem I had with it is that it has a slightly off putting soapy / metallic taste like the Havana Club 7, and I'm also going to guess that it has quite a bit of added sugar. Other than that it's a great bang for your buck rum, especially since how few of them there are in the Spanish style (at least in BC, most of the sub $50 bottles here are in the hardier English style).

Everynobody,2s7ys6,6,rum,Kilo Kai changed?,"So for Christmas a few years ago my brother got a bottle of Kilo Kai spiced rum for christmas. The bottle looked like [this](http://imgur.com/H3ZiKLP).

Black bottle, frosted finish, ect. Anyway me and my father thought the rum was very good. I'm normally not a fan of drinking spiced rums straight, but I felt this rum really stood on it's own. Very good balance of flavors, smooth finish.

Fast forward to his year and my dad got me a bottle of Kilo Kai for Christmas, remembering how good it was years ago. Thing is, the bottle is [different](http://imgur.com/5smIyHp). What's more, the rum is nothing like I remember.

My memory of the original bottle isn't super great, but this new one really isn't a good straight drinker. Really reminds me pretty intensely of cough syrup, if I'm honest. I'm not an expert taster or anything but usually I try and put a little bit of effort into identifying what I can, but with this rum straight I'm really having trouble getting past cough syrup. Not at all what I remember.

So after some quick googling I couldn't really find any reference to a change for this rum, so I'm wondering if anyone has any insight. Is the rum from the frosted bottle discontinued? If so, anyone know of a place that will ship to NY that still stocks them? I'd love to get a bottle of that older stuff if it is in fact a different rum.

To be fair, although I really don't like this new bottle straight, I think it makes a fantastic mixer. With ginger ale it really gives a me a cream soda vibe, and with coke it's a dead ringer for vanilla coke, which I love. So I'm enjoying the bottle, but wondering if anyone knows what changed or if maybe my palette has just shifted.",4,2015-01-13 07:37:01

Cocodrool,2tbg4a,17,rum,Ron de Venezuela,"Much has been said and I‚Äôve read a lot lately about all kinds of rum from so many places. To be completely honest, I‚Äôve tried very little of foreign rums, only limited to a sip of Kraken, a sip (and a spit) of Captain Morgan and a bunch of Zacapa 23. While I really can‚Äôt be a tasting expert in the ways of world rum, I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm knowledgeable enough in Venezuelan rum. 

Venezuelans have been making rum since the 16th century, and what makes Venezuelan rum special, aside from the incredible climate we have with high temperatures during the day and quite fresh at night, is that the internal regulations have been in place since the mid 50s and in a country where nothing really works, it‚Äôs been great to know that this does. The law has been placed to ensure that the only way liquor can be called ‚Äòrum‚Äô is if it has matured for a minimum of 2 years, as opposed to the usual 6 months from everywhere else.

This works amazingly, especially when I read that better-known rums like Bacardi barely have 6 months, yet the cheapest and worse rums in Venezuela tend to score very well on worldwide tastings. 

Since 2003, the Denominaci√≥n de Origen Controlada (Controlled Origin) organization started supervising the better creation and production of rum, to ensure that the quality is the absolute best. This organization is made by the makers of Roble Viejo, Santa Teresa, Tepuy, Carupano, Canaima, Estelar, Pampero, Diplom√°tico, Ocumare, Ca√±averal, Cacique, El Muco, and Veroes. 

I‚Äôve seen many rum brands being tried here and I‚Äôd like to point out that if you find a Venezuelan rum where you are, you give it a try, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised. I‚Äôd suggest, if you can find them, Roble Viejo Ultra A√±ejo, Cacique 500, Pampero Aniversario, and Carupano Solera Centenaria 21. 

[Here's a short album](http://imgur.com/a/j77xa) of the rums that are in the Denominaci√≥n de Origen list.

I'm an Aussie as well so pretty much the only rum we get is Bundaberg Rum (http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/) which is decent stuff but there are better options out there. I was at a bar the other week and the bartender reccomended me this - https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-4529.aspx


And it tasted great so I went and bought 3 bottles of it (Have to get it shipped over cause it's not in Aus, and I'm just looking at trying some others. Preferably around $40-$60 AUD. 

But I'm already looking at starting a colleciton, so far I have 1 bottle of ANGOSTURA 1824 RUM and I'm looking to expand that. I haven't opened that bottle and I'll probably leave it until a 20th Birthday or something so yeah

[deleted],2udwpe,1,rum,Rum Reviews 9 &amp; 10 Dominican Haul: Bermudez 1852 Aniversario and Brugal 1888,"My fianc√© and I recently went on vacation in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. While there, I decided to take advantage of the phenomenal prices to pick up a couple of rums that I have been really looking forward to trying: Bermudez 1852 Aniversario, and Brugal 1888. The Dominican style of rum is quite similar to other Spanish style rums, such as those from Cuba and Puerto Rico. These rums tend to be light and clean, with lots of woody oak character. The rums I have selected definitely follow this trend, and yet, they could not be more dissimilar. Let‚Äôs have a look:

First up for review is the Bermudez 1852 Aniversario. This rum is made in limited batches and bottled only once each year, by the oldest distillery in the Dominican: F. Armando Bermudez &amp; Co. The rum is aged, as far as I can tell, for somewhere between 12 years and 15 years, in toasted white oak barrels. The label itself, while completely in Spanish, boasts that this is a blend that is made with the most aged rums in the country. I was really excited to be bringing this one home, as it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a rum I could ever obtain on the east coast of Canada. For $750 Dominican pesos, ~$20 CAD a bottle, I jumped at the chance. 

**ABV**: 40%

**In The Bottle**: I love the green glass bottle that this comes in. To me, the bottle is antique looking and very similar in shape to an old champagne bottle. The label looks like it hasn‚Äôt been updated since they first started making the stuff and that‚Äôs just fine by me. The label boasts 12 award medals, going back to 1900. Above the label is a slightly tacky looking, gold-coloured, plastic emblem 
featuring the company‚Äôs lion-head logo. 

**In The Glass**: The Aniversario displays a deep gold hue in the glass, with what I swear is a slightly pink highlight. It‚Äôs rather light in colour for a well-aged rum, but this is not unusual for naturally coloured spirits. There‚Äôs definitely no e-150 here. The legs run nice and slow down the sides, but they‚Äôre not chunky. These are slim dancer‚Äôs legs, probably merengue dancer‚Äôs legs.

**Nose**:  The nose is floral, very buttery, and earthy. I detect butterscotch, salt water taffy, a briny sea breeze note, coconut macaroon, flan con leche, sultana, nutmeg, a touch of coriander, cinnamon, lots of woody oak and vanilla, honey. There‚Äôs a smokiness too, as well as a slightly medicinal, iodine note that I often get from Islay whisky, such as Ardbeg, but it is much lighter and more delicate here. Sweet and salty kettle corn, praline almonds, and a grassy sugar cane note. Like /u/thefatrumpirate, I‚Äôm noting some similarities between this and the Havana Club 7, so much so that I had to try them back to back. I must say that while both rums share similar iodine tang on the nose,  I much prefer the smell of the Aniversario. The HC 7 has a much sharper aroma that I find brittle and thin, while the Bermudez is rich and warm and complex.

**Taste**: Very nice dry rum character with a soft, medium-light mouthfeel. Lots of butterscotch, maple syrup (something I‚Äôve never detected in a rum) and vanilla fudge, Lindt dark chocolate (Madagascar 70% cocoa),  fried banana, slightly tangy lemon rind, damp earth, fresh cut grass, golden brown sugar, baklava, Dominican coffee (it must be the soil), and slightly briny.

**Final Thoughts**: A very pleasurable and well-crafted rum. This little beauty is complex, with well-defined aromas and flavours. Like most Dominican rums that I‚Äôve tried, the overarching themes are: soft, refined, and smooth. When this bottle runs out I will desperately miss it and will have to find some way of getting my ass back to the Dominican to pick up another bottle.

**Grade**: 91/100

-------------------------------------------------
The Brugal 1888 is a rum that claims to be tailor made for whisky lovers. This seems appropriate seeing as Brugal was purchased, in 2008, by The Edrington Group, the same company that owns Macallan and Highland Park. The influence on this rum is clear: A rum that is double aged, for at least 6 years in charred American white oak barrels that once housed bourbon, and again for another 2-4 years in ex-sherry butts. I purchased this one from a little corner store and it was roughly the same as what I would pay at home for this one: $2400 Dominican pesos, or ~$63 CAD. I loved the Brugal XV, let‚Äôs see how this one stacks up.

**ABV**: 38%

**In The Bottle**: Gorgeous and elegant bottle with the gold and blue label embossed directly onto the glass. The base of the bottle is super heavy and the stopper is quite possibly the best I‚Äôve ever encountered: a tight fitting cork with a heavy gold-coloured metal topper. A small label affixed to above the base of the bottle indicates that this is a limited edition rum that was bottled in 2011, with a lot number of 2, as well as the barrels used: American and Spanish Oak. The rum within is deep, dark mahogany with a reddish hue.

**In The Glass**: Very viscous and oily, with fat, droopy legs that meander down the sides of the glass at a Dominican pace (not rushing, very relaxed)

**Nose**: Big blast of sherry, almost Aberlour A‚Äôbunadh-esque, minus the intense alcohol and barley sugar. I‚Äôm getting notes of brown sugar, orange zest, dolce de leche, bourbon-y vanilla notes, plump cherries, prunes, medjool dates, rum raisin ice cream, nutmeg, clove, allspice, cinnamon, young coconut pulp, mushy banana, orange marmalade, molasses on buttered brown bread, woody oak. All very clean, and full, and luscious. 

**Taste**: Succulent stone fruits: cherries, apricots, medjool dates, as well as raisins, that vanilla from the bourbon cask, rich and fruity wild flower honey, marmalade, brown sugar, delicious sherry (of course). Intriguingly, this rum is both dry and quite sweet in equal measures. Like other rums from Brugal, the mouthfeel on the 1888 is absolutely remarkable. The Rumhowler described it as an, ‚Äúever-so light impression of baking soda‚Ä¶ giving the spirit a softer than usual mouth feel‚Äù. That‚Äôs about right on, the rum glides across the tongue, providing a pleasant tactile experience to compliment the rich taste and deeply fragrant aroma.

**Final Thoughts**: I love this rum! The Brugal 1888 is effectively the Aberlour A‚Äôbunadh of rum for me, right now. The packaging is classy and unpretentious, the nose is full and clean, the taste is mouth-wateringly delicious (and again super refined and clean). It just ticks so many boxes. The only thing I regret is that the bottle I purchased in the Dominican is only bottled at 38% ABV. I could have purchased it at the local NBLC for $70 at 40% ABV. Really, this rum should be bottled at 43% ABV at the very least in order to ensure maximum flavour. Regardless, this is still an outstanding rum.

**Grade**: 92/100

I'd like to start a discussion around budget rums.  Let's define budget as a rum that is regularly available for **$20 or less** in **750 mL bottle** format, please. 

For dark/gold rum, I usually gravitate towards Appleton V/X ($16 where I live in Oregon) or Bacardi 8 (often on sale for $18).  I know there are probably a lot of people here who hate on Bacardi, but Bacardi 8 is much better than you think.

For light rum, well, I don't have a regular.  I'm sorta looking for something to become my house light rum.  Nothing's stuck quite yet.

I typically mix rum.  If I have the Bacardi on hand, I'll sometimes sip it, but bourbon's what I usually go for if I'm in a sipping mood.

How about you guys?  What do you reach for when you've got 20 bucks and a hankering for rum?

ARatherOddOne,2ijuvo,12,rum,I finally tried non-spiced rum.,"I tried Appleton last night. Previously my only rum experience was spiced rums like Captain Morgan, Kraken, and Bacardi. I wasn't sure what to really expect other than some sweet flavor in it. 

Here are my thoughts on the drink: Appleton is really not shy about letting the alcohol hit you. I've had other drinks at 80 proof which masked the alcohol with some flavor but this is not one of them. It has a nice sweet taste initially and a little bitter after taste (I don't mind since I love bourbon). At first I didn't like it that much but as I drank it more it grew on me. I'm feeling that this brand in particular for me is more of an acquired taste but I do like it. I look forward to drinking it more down the road.

new2rums,2h0uqf,5,rum,I need rum suggestions and questions answered.,"First off, I was never much of a drinker, but 6 years after being legally able to drink, I decided to try and mix two thing I have always loved. I have always loved rum candy and I love love love colas.

I got myself a mexican coke mixed it with Kraken delicious. Kraken tastes nothing like rum candy, however.
I mixed Kraken with Jarritos cola, even better! Kraken still didn't remind me of rum candy.
I tried Bacardi Oakheart with coke, not as good. Oakheart tastes gross by itself. (however, Oakheart compliments Dr. Pepper very well)
I tried mixing Sailor Jerry with colas, even worse. It is just like sweet and alcohol like, no rum taste. Zaya 12 was a bust also, too sweet not what I think of when I desire the taste of rum.
I also tried Captain Morgan Black and I couldn't tell if I liked it, the ratios were way off. 

1) Is there a rum that is like rum candy in taste? Even one that tastes like buttered rum candy would be fine at this point. Is my idea of rum taste just wrong? Maybe Calypso, but I can't find it.

2) What is in Kraken that I like so much? I thought it was vanilla, but Zaya and Sailor Jerry have a lot of vanilla and it is kind of gross and overly done. Is it caramel or cinnamon or something?

3) Is Captain Morgan Black the same flavors as original, just more? Or are they different, because I don't think I liked CM Black (not sure).

4) What rums are like Kraken, whatever its traits are? Not necessarily black rums. I don't know all the cocktail lingo for flavors.

I am looking for cola mixers, I love cola.


Update: Elements 8, Lamb's Black Sheep, and Lemon Hart are not sold at either liquor store I went to. I instead bought a bottle of Gosling Black Seal and two smaller bottles of vast popularity to see if I liked them since Oakheart and Kraken were good. (Bacardi white and Original Captain Morgan in little bottles).

I just tried Captain Morgan Original and what first comes to mind is how insubstantial it is. It tastes good and I like it better than Sailor Jerry, but there isn't much there at all in terms of flavor depth, complexity, or even alcohol burn. Bacardi Superior has a flash of vanilla that disappears very quickly into an alcohol taste. I think I understand why this used strictly for mixing now.

I tried Gosling on the rocks, and I liked it a lot actually. It reminded me whiskey, which might seem odd. I don't generally enjoy whiskey either, adding to the oddity of me liking it. I can't wait to mix it tomorrow or maybe tonight. Although it was not like rum candy at all, I don't mind as it is quite unique and stands out from my now decent size collection.

Taking what Poopdish said, I think Bacardi Gold may in fact be the most rum candy like, at least by Bacardi's own description. ""BACARD√ç Gold features rich vanilla, buttery caramel, toasted almond and sweet banana notes with the warm zest of orange peel and a light tasting, oaky finish."" And they claim that it pairs well with cola. Although they also say this about most of their rums. But, I have only ever heard nasty things about Bacardi Gold. Are there other good gold rums? I think Calypso made the rum candy I had about twelve years ago that I fell in love with. If only I could find it Calypso rum. Somebody on the Huffington Post described it as bubblegum-esque.

Thanks everyone :D

Update 2: I couldn't get any store to ship to where I live. So no $20 Amrut Old Port Deluxe for me. No Lamb's, no Lemon Hart, no a lot of things I wanted to try. I looked for Cruzan Single Barrel at my store, no luck. Came down to Bacardi 8 year and El Dorado 8 year. I went with the El Dorado because I like RumHowler description of its flavors more. It tastes much better in Jarritos than it does in Jones as far as cola goes.

But my budget is blown now. My local liquor stores will stop carrying all but Superior and Gold Bacardis soon. For a rum and cola, did I choose wisely? Anybody have both Bacardi 8 and El Dorado 8 and willing to share insight?

new2rums,2hehs5,3,rum,I need you guys! Your tongue and rum collections to guide my purchase.,"I decided to make a second thread as the first one was very helpful.

I bought El Dorado 8. It is amazing. It tastes like toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, and supposedly tobacco (I don't smoke). I really enjoy the butterscotch (caramel?) even more than vanilla and cinammon flavors in rum which are also great. But reviews are often contrasting in flavor notes.

Bacardi 8 a√±os is said to be caramel heavy or fruity and oaky depending on the person you ask...
Amrut Old Port Deluxe has too few review. It either tastes like pistachios or butterscotch...
Captain Morgan Private Stock is said to taste like butterscotch or vanilla depending on the person you ask... 

So if you own any of these, care to help me out?

To make matters worse, most of the reviews were *intended* for whiskey, so I can't imagine all of the same principals apply. I'm a firm believer in drinking however you enjoy it most, but I'd like to know what some more seasoned rum enthusiasts think.

She's playfully reminded me about that a couple of times since then and her birthday is coming up. It's her 40th, so it's a milestone and my wife suggested buying her a bottle of good rum as a gift to replace the one I finished, but I'm fairly clueless about spirits in general (homebrew, craft and import beers are another story, however) and don't want to waste money on something that's marketed well, but is just crappy or average.

I've been a scotch guy for years, straight and from a glencairn like it should be. 

I recently came back from Jamaica where I had some aged Appleton at a tasting. The 12 and the vx were great, and I never knew rum could benefit from being drunk the way whisky is drank. 

The notes I picked up were awesome, deep vanillas, pineapple, banana. Just wow

I picked up a Kirk and Sweeney 12, I need to try it more, but I definitely felt something missing. 

Besides that, I picked up kraken and with ice (which was different for me) it was great, haven't tried it totally neat yet. And as a mixer it was perfect.

So suggestions! Good aged and good dark spiced? 

What should a scotch drinker try with the rum world?!

civilianapplications,2brghw,7,rum,Beenleigh's 5 year old,"This review is split into two sections. My first impressions and then what i thought about it about two and a half weeks later. I bought this bottle of [Beenleigh](http://imgur.com/DCZIG5v)  because despite being Australian ive never had much time for Australian rum and i thought making a change from Caribbean rums would be interesting. 

First Impression:
As soon as i opened the cap and got a whiff i had a bad feeling about this one. Medicine, sweet cough medicine is all i can smell....oh no what have i done.

I poured some, hoped i was wrong and took a sip. 

More medicine,a sort of artificial cherry flavour medicine, and very sweet. What few flavours my limited palette can discern don't hang around very long and are drowned out by the all powerful medicine, which also lingers for far too long. Its like the flavour is stuck on the roof of my mouth. I decide to put it away until i can buy some ginger beer.

I thought if i cant drink it neat at least ill be able to mix it. The medicine flavour still shines through the ginger beer, but its more of a counter-note to the ginger now. I still don't think it makes the best dark and stormy ive ever had (goslings works better) but its drinkable in this form. 

Second Impression:
After drinking about half the bottle with ginger beer, i go back to having the stuff neat.

Smells a lot better this time around and im not as overwhelmed. Acetone, banana maybe, also some vanilla and caramel as you would expect. Still has some of the cherry cough syrup smell but it seems more balanced and it gets quickly cut off by the alcohol.

The taste has also improved somewhat, still very sweet and fruity but now the medicinal cherry only arrives at the end with the alcohol burn. It then remains as the dominant lingering taste, still somewhat unpleasant, but less unpleasant than it was the first time.

At the moment that's all i can really say, ive never been very good at describing what i can taste. I think id like this rum a lot more if it were less sweet and balanced better.The cough syrup is still just too strong.

I wouldn't buy a bottle again, i wouldn't drink it straight, but i could see how some might enjoy this rum straight or mixed. Unless you live in Australia or its already at a reasonable price in your country i wouldn't buy it until you can try a sample.

Has anyone else tried it?, id be very curious to hear what you think of it.

Edit: Have been drinking it with Tonic water now and its quite good. almost reminds me a bit of campari and lemonade",1,2014-07-26 14:27:34

thetieguy,2ca6nf,9,rum,"Fairly recent rum drinker, my thoughts on a brand not mentioned here often. Brugal.","Hey there,

I've been drinking rum and cokes for years but decided to take rum seriously about 6 months ago. My favorites are 

Ron Zacapa 23 for regular sipping, neat. 

Ron Zacapa 15 for I need a sipper not a mixer but I'm on a budget.

I have a bottle of the Ron Zacapa XO, it is quite amazing, the extra 2 years in cognac casks really change it up but I wouldn't buy it again for a while at $100+ a bottle. 

I bought a bottle of El Dorado 15, and to be honest I don't like it that much. I find it to be very flat when compared to a Zacapa and I don't think it opens up as much as I'd like. 

I'm currently sipping on Brugal 1888. Ever since Brugal (a dominican rum) was bought by the same owners as Macallan, they've really jumped onto the premium rum bandwagon. They released the Brugal XV, the Brugal 1888, the Siglo De Oro (I believe currently only available in the DR) and the ridiculous Brugal Papa Andres, of which only 50 decanters have been allocated to the US and it  can cost about 2,000 Euros. 

Most of these premium Brugal rums are aged for the most part in medium charred bourbon barrels. It's interesting, I've never tried a rum that smelled and felt so much like a whiskey. 

Just something to think about. I know in Texas the Brugal 1888 is not to be found, but if you find it, pick it up and give it a try.

TheDeech,288imd,9,rum,Rum around the world tasting party advice,"So, I've been having a lot of fun turning my friends on to the variety of tastes offered by rums from around the world of various ages and styles. 

However, it's been sort of ad-hoc, as people come visit, or if I'm at the bar and am making a recommendation. 

After some discussion at the bar last night, I offered to have a rum tasting party, where I can present a series of different rums from around the world, side by side, as a way to explore all the different nuances of various distillers and styles.  

The question I have for all of you is, which rums do you think exemplify the various geographic regions? 

So far, I have:
 
* Ron Zacapa Centenario (23 Solero) - Guatemala 

* Rhum Barbancourt 15 - Haiti

* El Dorado 8 - Guyana (though, I will likely find a bottle of 15 or 21. I want an excuse to buy the 21)

* Angostura 1824 -Trinidad 

* Flor De Cana 18 and 7 - Nicaragua

* Appleton Estate V/X - Jamaica

* Don Q - Purto Rico 


I've got a few others in mind (for instance, I plan to use this as an excuse to hunt down a bottle of the Flor De Cana Centenario 21), but this is just what I have on hand currently. A few of these are quite good, but I don't think it's an altogether strong showing. What do you all think? If you were to present a good showing of various regions rum, what would you suggest?  Note: I do want to present stuff across the spectrum of cost, for instance in the Flor De Cana, what the younger rums taste like compared to the older.

Pricewise is variable. I'm not adverse to spending money on good rum, but buying several bottles at one go might stretch my budget a bit. I'm also looking for reasonably mainstream availability. I'm sure that one limited reserve special pressing bottle is the absolute pinnacle of taste for a region, but if I can't find it or it's $200 a bottle, that's not going to be helpful. :)

Originally, I intended to make daiquiris, but upon smelling this stuff, wow.  I ended up sipping it on the rocks.  This stuff blew me away.  I've only ever had cheapo rum before.  I had no idea rum could taste like this.  What a nose!  Vanilla, brown spice, orange peel, dried fruit...it's amazing!!!!!!!!!  I'm looking forward to exploring the world of premium rums.  Any thoughts on what I should try next?  Honestly, I should probably spend a little less and work my way up.",6,2014-06-08 10:33:55

Tindi,23n0e3,3,rum,Any good rums made in Belize?,"I'm down in Belize for a week. Everywhere we go, they are selling rum and talking about Belize rum. I don't know if they are actually known for rum. I don't know of any Belizean rums. Most of it looks new like Bacardi or something. I picked up a pint of 1 Barrel which I see in all the bars. My immediate impression is caramel and rubbing alcohol. It's not even good mixed with Coke. I should say my favourite rums are Ron Zacapa, Havanna Club, Mount Gay, El Dorado, and others. Anything I should be looking for in Belize or is it a lot of hype just as I suspect?",5,2014-04-22 08:49:18
EdmundXXIII,23qyxb,6,rum,Review: Cruzan Black Strap Rum,"Nose: STRONG Molasses &amp; Maple.

Palate: Maple, Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Molasses.

Finish: Cloyingly Sweet, Molasses, Maple.

This rum is not subtle. It's in-your-face with strong aromas and flavors, most notably Molasses and Maple, although the Vanilla come through as well. But none of this is necessarily a bad thing. You don't drink Black Strap Rum if you're looking for subtlety or sophistication. The one downside is that the flavors are so strong it's not the best for mixing. It overpowers coke, and it ruins a daiquiri. It makes an OK Dark 'n Stormy. But with such a strong, forward flavor, I've found it best for sipping. But only when I'm in the mood for something this bold. It actually works pretty well as a follow-up to a more sophisticated dark rum, if you're in the mood for ""desert."" But I wouldn't start the evening with it.

Score: 7/10.",1,2014-04-23 14:22:25
LCalrissian,23sxks,6,rum,Looking for a rum cocktail for my wedding,"Hi all, I'm getting married in a few weeks and I'm trying to pick out a custom cocktail.  I initially wanted a rum old fashioned, but then began to fear it might be too strong and not a crowd-pleaser for anyone who doesn't have my love for rum.  So I switched to a dark and stormy, but that just seems too plain.

Do you guys have any recommendations for a rum-based cocktail that is drinkable but not as boring as a rum and coke or a dark and stormy?  Requirements: Must not have 1000 ingredients and take the bartenders 3 hours to make, musn't get my guests wasted after one glass, must be good with either 10 Cane, Kraken, Plantation 5yr, or Bacardi (the available rums).",8,2014-04-24 05:36:15

I don't post here often but I do love sipping rums.  I'm partial to zacapa 23 and goslings old world rum...but wanted to ask if any of the tastier companies produce a small bottle option?  My fiance and I doing welcoming bags for our wedding and thought it would be cool to add something in the bag for a nightcap.  

I figured no harm in asking!",4,2014-05-01 05:18:45

MonkeyTes,24ls4z,7,rum,New to rum and need advice.,"Hey everyone! I am primarily a whiskey drinker from a family of whiskey drinkers, and have not had the opportunity to broaden my drinking horizons, until now that is. 

First a bit about myself. I am 21, graduate college next week and start grad school this fall so I can only buy $30+  bottles on occasion. Most of my drinking to this point has been bourbons, whiskeys, and scotches from my family and a few I found myself. I prefer to drink my liquor either on the rocks or neat, I don't mix much and stay away from sugary add ons.

Now for my questions:

How do you drink your rum?

What kind of glassware is used?

What are common regions/types of rum?

What flavors do you look for in rum?

What is your favorite bottle?

What is your decently priced go to?

Coming from whiskey are there some rums I would appreciate more?

Thanks everyone I can't wait to read your responses!

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the great recommendations and advice! I will be purchasing my first bottle of Eldorado later today and will report back with my findings!",18,2014-05-03 14:08:05
