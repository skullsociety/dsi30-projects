really say would consider fan certain distillery even single expression although buffalo trace springbank perform possibly better aggregate others really converted foursquare fan bought different bottles almost exploring anything else rum world say also got get best stuff world bit lower prices whisky looking prices actually sure true get good staples whisky world one first baseline find whisky parallels would say something like laphroaig quarter cask macallan weller antique balanced rich yet focused particular message wants deliver little distraction unpleasant notes need tolerate order get main delivery message christmassy nutmeg clove sugar taste many friends tasted said even seem like rum could plausibly see anyone likes whisky would like many friends said like rum told may never rum eye opener made want understand foursquare range would say exactly like specific clove christmas taste comes much earlier arrival less towards finish knot consistent observation slightly less sweet full round seductive put side side actually bit different christmassy flavour distributed seems less one dimensional diffuse really better enjoy hit face nutmeg cloves read higher pot still component previous years explaining odd one complex less sweet especially taste pure potstill sort see great good price although maybe seem get sold worried stockpiling would excited buy new vintage every year series also work old fashioned even sour still carry big flavour price point also tolerable drink neat blended small amount together good seemed converge like hereditas whisky metaphor feels like distiller edition laphroaig triple wood feel understand straight forward message classic sherry finish takes level adds richer yet confusing undertow obscures clear hook bad thing direct comparison sherry syrup makes something like seem bit thin much like specific moment get clove christmas punch face wonder could add sherry let sit bit maybe recreate part experience tried delicious way glad say way acidic fresh fruity rather dark stewed fruits one favourite far also one guests although really say steal might pick backup let bit patrimonio worried hereditas sell special occasion open patrimonio dominus lot like would say dryer tannic finish consistent cask suppose overall mainstream foursquare paper looks similar plantation xo put side side see outclasses sweetened plantation mile habitation velier buy reading review influential tarquin underspoon two key things pot still rest blend column pot also aged years cognac casks though presumably powerful one clearly less value money risk however curious building blocks standard foursquare basically single malt equivalent less wood influence rarely excited open bottle different indeed savoury complex reminders agricole jamaican styles olives banana idea even component series confusion felt actually foreshadowed review tarquin underspoon lead buy expecting reveal part construction blend makes really curious ever possible try foursquare pure column still nikka coffey malt banger say nothing wrong column stills profits water opinion overall cannot say delicious encompassing hereditas also ff like sort thing something like hampden overproof take much funky direction possibly far sure real rum experts targeted enjoy lot would first recommendation however tasting similarity foursquare releases one absolute joy refreshing salty complex weird coming back months wonder one could end favourite one day though spiced obviously unsurprisingly different spices half price abv would say taste like add cinnamon add lots water add unpleasant metallic note terms sipping would recommend however tried old fashioned sour great sour maybe old fashioned make add spiced little extra oomph interesting realize tasting explicitly flavoured alcohol interesting subtle refined flavours rum whisky evoke cinnamon clove without flavours actually added veritas mix foursquare column hampden pot clear oily fresh strange made sipping although interesting sip one really holds together shines mixed drink olive funkiness really goes well together acidity sugar cocktail could bit cheaper suppose purpose velvet falernum bad could quite get work yet corn oil cocktail live neat class pure spirits finally unopened premise uncertain whether add sagacity empery described dry wanted honestly would go habitation velier direction tried two single barrel options smws wanted buy took still unopened tasted lot like habitation velier although years wonder full pot still could say sure conclusion think maybe level whisky appreciation going online reading reviews buying well reviewed bottles means limited releases playing catch pay high price community settled winners course many special releases snapped experts within days hitting shelves reviews available higher level clearly know producers trust buy new special releases moment become available blind one review first may never get point whisky foursquare might would predict keep buying exceptional cask series especially finished ones unopened patrimonio special occasion premise reduced number open bottles also interesting exceptional cask series quite cheap
