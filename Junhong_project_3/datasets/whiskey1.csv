Sampling Whisky at a budget ,Okay so this might be a stupid question but please bear with me I ve been into cigars for a while now and the great thing about cigars is that to sample i e to learn the taste of a brand model you don t need to buy a whole box of cigars You can just buy a stick and have an experience of the brand However in whisky in my knowledge you usually have to get full sized cc bottles very expensive I know some brands produce small bottles and I ve had them but most of them don t For example to be able to taste a good Yamazaki you don t have a small bottle option you need to drop even if you want just to get a sip if you know what I mean Now are there any alternatives to this Any organizations that sell produce ml ml samples etc Or is there any other way I can sample whisky without having to buy huge bottles which I have no idea if I will finish What would be your advice to me What are your opinions on this issue Thx ,1,Sampling Whisky at a budget  Okay so this might be a stupid question but please bear with me I ve been into cigars for a while now and the great thing about cigars is that to sample i e to learn the taste of a brand model you don t need to buy a whole box of cigars You can just buy a stick and have an experience of the brand However in whisky in my knowledge you usually have to get full sized cc bottles very expensive I know some brands produce small bottles and I ve had them but most of them don t For example to be able to taste a good Yamazaki you don t have a small bottle option you need to drop even if you want just to get a sip if you know what I mean Now are there any alternatives to this Any organizations that sell produce ml ml samples etc Or is there any other way I can sample whisky without having to buy huge bottles which I have no idea if I will finish What would be your advice to me What are your opinions on this issue Thx

Why is Old Forester Birthday Bourbon so incredibly hard to find that no one can buy it ,I got into whiskey several years ago though started diving deep into bourbon in the past year or so Through the time I ve made some acquaintances and good friendships with some stores in several states I m really trying to be ahead of the game and track down the upcoming Birthday Bourbon release My small store or even larger store owner operators tell me yeah good luck with that or I ve seen that bottle once in my career of years here So is this whiskey that incredible that it s god s gift to earth Is it the rarity or the hype train of the whiskey boom we are currently in I digress What s the point of advertising or hyping such a whiskey that not even knowing a guy matters where that guy runs high volume doors How would a layman even attempt to purchase something like this ,1,Why is Old Forester Birthday Bourbon so incredibly hard to find that no one can buy it  I got into whiskey several years ago though started diving deep into bourbon in the past year or so Through the time I ve made some acquaintances and good friendships with some stores in several states I m really trying to be ahead of the game and track down the upcoming Birthday Bourbon release My small store or even larger store owner operators tell me yeah good luck with that or I ve seen that bottle once in my career of years here So is this whiskey that incredible that it s god s gift to earth Is it the rarity or the hype train of the whiskey boom we are currently in I digress What s the point of advertising or hyping such a whiskey that not even knowing a guy matters where that guy runs high volume doors How would a layman even attempt to purchase something like this

A humble review Ichiro s Malt Ace of Diamonds,Whiskey people Dear Readers First apologies for my long and silent absence The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated When last we chitted and chatted I received quite the virtual tongue lashing for daring to speak nay type my innermost thoughts on whiskey The veritable cornucopia of comments brimming with toxic and slanderous scoldings would be enough to drive any writer whisky or otherwise off the internet for good So off I limped into the dark corners of the Reddit com messaging forums licking my wounds chagrined from the heapings of scorn of my fellow whiskey enthuses Back I am though Here to once again unleash my raging thoughts upon the whisky world and community Reinvigorated with whiskey tinged gusto Second Konnichiwa yoi tsuitachi Whilst breaking from the Whiskey Network I was most certainly not braking my whisky journey nor resting upon my laurels The world called to me as doth a mother to her heifer Come and see Live Experience Drink Love Partake All this can be yours and more Now never have I ever been one to ignore the call of wanderlust I hastily packed a lightweight suitcase jet setting off into the sunset to see my penultimate lady lover Gaia Earth in all her lustrous glory It should be noted here that my travel was during and All of my notes were jotted down previously and I have taken the time to hone 磨ぐ my prose If you have yet to guess my travels landed me in the Land of the Rising Sun Dai Nippon JAPAN Admittedly Dai Nippon tugs at my core being I am forever entranced by Japanese Culture Fear not Dear Reader I am not some weeaboo dedicated to worshipping at the altar of Kawaii chasing some imaginary dragon for ever smallening and cutening memorabilia Nay my love and curiosity come from a place of deep respect or Ikei no nen 畏敬の念 From this place of ikei I sought to find the rarest and most luscious of the unicorns the fabled Ichiro s Malt the Deck of Card series I spent many a night in the streets of Tokyo in samayō for these rare and hidden gems As luck would have it I found them at several places though much much too 高い expensive Then on the eve of my last night when all hope seemed lost and I was at my wit s end I found one The famous Ace of Diamonds open and at a price that seemed too good to be true SUGOI We shall see if it is true what the great Ralphy has said which is that while the Scotsman may have invented Scotch it was the Japanese who perfected it Paraphrasing Some will be happy to note I ve changed my review methods as many complained it too verbose Drinking with my eyes A viscous melange of gilded lilies dried orange rind and autumnal hay Drinking with my nose Sweet molasses cream barbecued shrimp fermented soy sauce a wet forest after a summer rain or petricore Drinking with my tongue Sweet Christmas Oishii Creamy buttered potatoes lilac infused essential oils poppy seeded muffins toasted marshmallows チョコレート fresh cut grass wet with the morning dew Final thoughts and musings Oh How my senses they do sing If Shakespeare was not writing about women surely he was writing about this malt So perfect So subtle So gentle このウイスキーをのんでながら

Just tried an Islay Scotch,I m very new to alcohol It s been about months since my first drink at age long story And I just tried an Ardbeg for my first Islay scotch It tastes very very strongly of smoked meat to me Is this a pretty common profile for these types of scotches I thought it was delicious Also does anyone have recommendations for whiskeys with similar bottles I should try that are similar to Ardbeg ,1,Just tried an Islay Scotch I m very new to alcohol It s been about months since my first drink at age long story And I just tried an Ardbeg for my first Islay scotch It tastes very very strongly of smoked meat to me Is this a pretty common profile for these types of scotches I thought it was delicious Also does anyone have recommendations for whiskeys with similar bottles I should try that are similar to Ardbeg 
Tastebuds need a bake , I tried attempted to Google my question I couldn t find anything I had the liquor store bourbon guy tell me if all you drink is whisk e y bourbon then you ll eventually start getting one similar taste and no longer be able to tell the difference between some juice s He claimed that the solution to it was weening off of whatever it is you re drinking I pretty much only drink bourbon and he suggested I move on to tequila or Irish whiskey s Is there any truth to this The more you drink a style the more susceptible one is to having a muting loss of flavors occur ,1,Tastebuds need a bake   I tried attempted to Google my question I couldn t find anything I had the liquor store bourbon guy tell me if all you drink is whisk e y bourbon then you ll eventually start getting one similar taste and no longer be able to tell the difference between some juice s He claimed that the solution to it was weening off of whatever it is you re drinking I pretty much only drink bourbon and he suggested I move on to tequila or Irish whiskey s Is there any truth to this The more you drink a style the more susceptible one is to having a muting loss of flavors occur

My Whiskeys of ,Here s a very quick list of the various whisky and whiskey brands I ve tried over the course of With more time staying in I figured I should branch out a little bit try bottles I d seen or heard of but never tasted Now there were other old favorites that I had at some point so this isn t exactly everything I drank during and these weren t all full size ml bottles but it is my list by memory of the brands I tried for the first time ever and what I can cobble together as to why I liked or didn t like them Disclaimer I have no palette when it comes to clearly identifying what something is like I can t really put into words why something tastes good and I have a poor memory for why I liked it which is a long way of saying that I can t really write a good full review This is more like my quick notes on what was good what I was disappointed about and suggestions for others in the same boat as me What I usually drink is stuff like Woodford Reserve or Basil Hayden s and for Scotch mostly Balvenie or Glenlivet My typical glass is with either a splash of water or an ice cube but that s it never mixed drinks other than the occasional gin and tonic in the summer I like scotch plenty but when it comes to spending money I just find a better value in bourbon or American whiskey options so that makes up the majority of what I buy I don t venture too often into rye Canadian or Irish whiskey nor flavored stuff like honey this or apple that Also I m vaguely trying to list these in something close to order based on when I bought them oldest to most recent but it s imperfect Not that you d know that but just realize I typically finish off a bottle before opening the next one so some of these are from most of a year ago Proper no Twelve Irish Whiskey proof One of a few bottles I got from a going out of business sale last winter so I figured I would try it I ve not had a lot of Irish whiskeys compared to the American or Scottish options I m an MMA fan so I d seen countless ads for it I had low expectations but actually it more than exceeded that This tasted quite good in my opinion kind of standard in terms of taste but smooth enough and with some sweetness It s hard to compare to something I haven t had in like years but by my recollection I didn t like Jameson nearly as much but I d have to try it again someday Brenne French Single Malt Whisky proof This was really quite unique It s not cheap but I got it on sale so I was happy with that There s something about it that s very distinct but I can t quite put my finger on it but I liked it s quite a lot Maybe it was light and sweet or maybe kind of floral Sorry I can t describe it better it has been a long about months or so since I finished it but I think worth a try Side note beautiful bottle design I know that s not a reason to buy a drink but just wanted to give some appreciation for when a brand puts in the extra effort and makes something that tastes good but also looks interesting on the shelf Mossburn Island Scotch year Blended Malt Whisky proof Also bought on sale but this one was disappointing note if you are paying attention the same sale as the previous bottles This was had during the spring shut down and I just recall it being harsh and underwhelming Honestly it wasn t as good as the Proper No I ve always tried to stay away from cheap scotch since you re paying for the import and the prestige but so often anything that s under or I just find unenjoyable But this isn t even that cheap Looking up just now the price my store sells this for Not to put everything as value or for the price but for that price range I d much rather Aberlour or Glenlivet year single malt Scotchs that are smoother more complex choices I ve come back to several times over the years Nobushi Japan Blended Whisky proof This was a bottle I got at a wholesale club and figured I would try it I ve had a couple of Japanese whiskys over the years but it s not something that comes up that often compared to bourbon or Scotch This is really distinct but I mean that in a good way There s a sort of fruity and long slow finish that I think has like a pause and then a nd finish in a way Hard to describe but I loved it Very good value and if you want something different pick this up The bottle design here is very bland so if you think it s boring the whisky inside is not I will be buying this again at some point This sells local to me for around per ml and I think that s a reasonable price for a memorable drink Jack Daniel s Gentleman Jack Tennessee Whiskey proof Okay not trying for a hot take but I just have never been a Jack fan It s not that it s bad exactly but it just doesn t jump out as either memorable or really great So I picked up a small sample of Gentleman Jack but wasn t thrilled I think this confirms Jack is for mixing with soda not sipping neat Of course it s a popular standard option that you ll literally find in like every bar around the world but trying this just confirmed for me that I will continue to think of all versions of Jack Daniels as a brown liquor option for mixing not as good as most of the rest of this list Four Roses Bourbon Whiskey proof This was a suggestion from the Reddit as a very good value bourbon and that it is It goes for around per ml and it s maybe the best option at that price This has become my new standard for something less expensive but smooth and really nice It s not exactly special but I like it quite a lot I kind of hate to keep saying it s like a good value and that s what makes it a good buy in my book Four Roses Small Batch Whiskey proof Ditto but better Maybe better is hard to say but more complex The higher proof does seem to come through a bit but it s certainly a really nice choice Granted I was trying to branch out this year but this and the regular Four Roses are the only ones so far that I ve bought a nd time this past year I feel a little bad saying it makes me think of a standard bourbon since some might take that to mean boring or average or not distinct If I were to describe it that way all I mean by it is that this is what bourbon SHOULD taste like and you re getting a good product out of it Monkey Shoulder year Blended Scotch proof Here I thought that good cheap Scotch was an oxymoron and then I go and try something like this and it totally redeems that segment I have liked Chivas Regal before as a good option but this does stand out as an excellent choice for a year blended Scotch I d certainly take it over Johnnie Walker red or black though I haven t had either in many years so maybe I should revisit them I don t know if there s much about it that really seems obviously a scotch vs a whiskey from somewhere else in the world but it s a solid option This will become something I do buy again down the line budget friendly but still agreeable in every sense of that word One note but nothing you can do about it terrible name I googled the why and it s about the condition that came from making the stuff a long time ago so I appreciate the nod to it s origins Just doesn t sound as timeless as others out there and I d say they might be missing a few sales based on that Elija Craig Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey proof Very good Again based on what I frequently saw people suggesting on reddit it s smooth and nice And in a way like with the Four Roses Small Batch this is what I think of when I hear the word bourbon And for a fair value given both the high abv highest I had this year while not tasting harsh I was surprised to check the label and see how high the proof My usual assumption is that you get more of that burn but it s kept in check here Jefferson s Very Small Batch Blend Bourbon Whiskey proof This is quite a good option yet again Along the same lines of Elijah Craig or the Four Roses Small Batch this is what a good bourbon should taste like to me Smooth but has a little bit of a bourbon kick to it a really well made option for something to drink straight and at a reasonable price of vaguely If we had to choose I think I d sooner buy the FR or EC before this one next time but from an enjoyment perspective you can t go wrong with either in my opinion Biggest complaint the bottle is nice looking but terrible to actually pour and it tends to drip due to the spout being very small Okay so that s my quick list of a few whisky and whiskey I tried during If this list sounds like too many I promise I don t have a problem and some of these were small bottles or what we in Massachusetts call nips If it sounds like too few I did also have my share of beer and a little wine in between My biggest pleasant surprises are maybe Four Roses and Monkey Shoulder as I may not have tried them before if not for reading what people were posting out online If I had to break my past year into price categories I d say cheap Four Roses wins in the under group Elijah Craig in the range and Nobushi for the option Obviously the only one here I was truly disappointed in was that Mossburn blended year but one less than stellar bottle a year is a minor price to pay for how many excellent whisky and whiskey brands are available Let me know what you think if there s something here you agree or disagree with of course and if you have a question I can attempt to give an answer but as I said above I might not be the most helpful I like what I like and sometimes I want to return what I ve bought but that is rare And of course if there some recommendation based on this list by all means tell me what to

Whiskey Spoilage Advice Needed,I ve been collecting whiskey for about a year now and I recently stopped and realized I have over open bottles Most are one half to full As you can see I like sampling different bottles but it takes me a while to get through them I ve recently learned that whiskey bottles go bad after years depending on light exposure air and temperature As a result I am a little worried about opening up any new bottles even though I just picked up some really excited pickups I am starting an infinity bottle which allows me to empty my less than half finished bottles so they don t go bad That s the best idea I ve found Also plan on having some get togethers once covid is over But in the meantime How do y all manage this Am I being too concerned about spoilage ,1,Whiskey Spoilage Advice Needed I ve been collecting whiskey for about a year now and I recently stopped and realized I have over open bottles Most are one half to full As you can see I like sampling different bottles but it takes me a while to get through them I ve recently learned that whiskey bottles go bad after years depending on light exposure air and temperature As a result I am a little worried about opening up any new bottles even though I just picked up some really excited pickups I am starting an infinity bottle which allows me to empty my less than half finished bottles so they don t go bad That s the best idea I ve found Also plan on having some get togethers once covid is over But in the meantime How do y all manage this Am I being too concerned about spoilage

Results of a head to head taste test, I made a post about whiskey s and had some interested parties asking for a follow up after the tastings So I made the sacrifice and tasted all of them back to back while taking some notes on the nose taste and finish I ll compile them here for anyone interested in either of the whiskey s sampled Please keep in mind that what follows is what I personally was able to smell taste and identify While you might get similar results you could also get completely different results and that s part of the beauty of whiskey Everyone s experience will differ slightly I m also not a sommelier and only got into drinking whiskey or months ago so I could be misidentifying some notes I compared bourbons one of which was below the other of which was above The goal was to figure out what if anything makes the more expensive option a better buy I did the exact same thing with scotches In hindsight I should have taken the bottles out of their boxes but bah where s the fun in removing the mystery It might also be worth mentioning that I m from the San Francisco Bay Area in CA so our Total Wine has a huge selection of whiskey The bourbons I chose From left to right Chestnut Farms over and Angel s Envy Beginning with the Chestnut Farms BiB Bourbon Nose muted oaky sweet but not in the traditional caramel vanilla sense Taste oaky with a hint of spice that quickly dissipates My dad described it as a firework that goes off in your mouth and then dissapears Vanilla with a smoothness that gradually brings a burn which sits on the lips and back of the tongue I experienced a very pleasant tingling sensation on my lips in particular Finish dry and oaky nothing complicated Allows you to sit and contemplate the amount of money you just swallowed Compare it to the Angel s Envy which I had very high expectations for Nose full bodied with plenty of spice and sweet vanilla Of the two this one smelled the nicest Taste sweet smooth caramel maple syrup It s only ABV so it kicks noticeably less Finish bittersweet chocolate long and low It might not be obvious from the notes but these two bourbons were surprisingly distinct they could have been two completely different types of whiskey That being said I think the Angel s Envy gives you a lot more to experience for a very reasonable price I d have no problem shelling out for the uniqueness of the Chestnut Farms but it s a much purer bourbon and in being so lacks the diversity in smell and taste provided by the Angel s I rate both in the uper of bourbon s I ve tried so far Next up the scotch whiskeys I chose From left to right The Macallan Double Cask or so and Glenfiddich Beginning with The Macallan Nose sweet oak toffee this was the primary note for me pear with an earty tone the secondary note Surprisingly complex without being obnoxiously so Taste like a cap gun the toffee and oaky fruitiness goes off with a bang in your mouth and quickly dissipates leaving a slight burn on your tongue or back of the palate with residual sweetness Not quite as smooth as the Glenfiddich but still easy to swallow Finish sweet subtle and lingering Not as dry as the others and there s nothing new or crazy that comes out in the finish It s pleasant and like the Chestnut Farms gives you some time to think about how much money you ve swallowed Compared to the Glenfiddich Nose sweet undeniably pear Carries a hint of the typical scotch smell Taste sweet fruity buttery smooth Hint of oak Slowly brings on a burn that sits on the tongue Finish sweet maintains fruitiness Not very long flavors go away almost dissapointingly quickly This was a much more even match I admittedly have quite a bit of bias since this exact Glendfiddich was my first exposure to scotch a couple months ago which I immediately loved but I m also a fan of The Macallan as an icon in pop culture Jeff Winger s go to whiskey throughout the entire show Community is The Macallan neat In the end I have to go with value and say that for the price you d be hard pressed to beat Glenfiddich It s fruity and fun dangerously smooth and shockingly low priced The Macallan takes the same flavors and gives them some maturity adding depth and dignity to them which makes for a wonderful experience if a bit of an expensive one Once it s all said and done I consider them all to be really good whisky any of which I d drink in a heartbeat That being said and with the full knowledge that knowing what they cost forms a bias when I buy these again I don t think I ll be buying the more expensive versions While both the Chestnut Farms and The Macallan Double Cask have some wonderfully unique experiences in each sip I can t justify the price They re good but not so much better that they re worth more than twice as much The bottles are gorgeous I ll give them that much Angel s Envy surprised me by living up to and then exceeding my expectations for a port barrel aged bourbon I didn t expect it to be so smooth or have such depth of flavor so I m definitely adding that to my buy this bourbon list And I m excited to see how it acts in an old fasioned or manhattan If you re looking into trying a scotch I cannot recommend Glenfiddich enough This scotch alone is what s preventing me from calling myself a bourbon drinker The Speyside distilleries produce some delicious whiskeys that come out smooth sweet and simple Nothing complicated or dynamic no weird flavors or unexpected textures just sweet smooth fruity deliciousness The Speyside region used to be part of the Highland which takes up most of Scotland It became its own region most likely due to the fact that despite being so small it contains most of the distilleries in the country To quote Raymond Reddington from the show The Black List If you d be so kind as to pick out a single malt a highland isla water tastes like seaweed and iodine I ve tried a Johnny Walker or two and a disgusting mixed scotch called Creag Isle and this little bottle of

A Discussion About Sourced Whisk e y Japanese Whisky,This wonderful gent over at r WhiskeyTribe made this fun info graph and I offered to share what I know about Japanese whisky It took me a long time to write so I figured I d share and open up a discussion on sourced whiskies I wanted to paint an entire picture for you before you go making a chart that people start relying on It s important to note a lot of things that get overly simplified probably because there s not too much info out there If you d like to learn more about legit Japanese whisky producers on an individual level feel free to ask didn t go into it for the sake of time Whisky Rising by Stefan Van Eycken and The Way of Whisky by Dave Broom are amazing resources for anyone that wants to learn more JP WHISKY LAWS First thing to note making whisky is Japan is a very vague concept Japan has officially been making whisky for less than years Before that it was trial and error and honestly nothing similar to what we would define as whisky today Additionally who knew Japanese whisky would blow up in the way that it did Now that is has we have people who ARE making whisky and we have even more people who have found loopholes and are selling sourced whisky AS Japanese whisky It is very hard to draw the line of who s making whisky for right wrong reasons and this is probably why the Japanese government hasn t really done anything about it But now we have Whisky Associations that are stepping up to make this change themselves The Tokyo Whisky and Spirits Competition is organized by them and if you want to enter you must follow their requirements Mashing of the grain and saccharification without Koji see Shochu Vs Whisky paragraph fermentation distillation and year aging must all take place in Japan Blending or bottling can take place outside of Japan which is interesting The only real law regarding Japanese whisky is your establishment needs to have a whisky license Which just means that you can house whisky doesn t emphasize on the production aspect But even though there are no laws the respectable Japanese whisky distillers typically follow scotch law Aged min years min ABV and obv made in Japan Your current definition of Japanese whisky that you put in the new graph says Whisky distilled from cereal grains Aged in wooden barrels I believe this is the US s definition of whisky This comes into play when we look at the aged shochu category aka Rice Whisky SHOCHU VS WHISKY Real quick ELI think of shochu as distilled sake brewed rice beverage that has ABV similar to wine Except it can be made with any grain barley potato rice sugarcane buckwheat and some ppl also use unique things like tomatoes It can be distilled once or twice BUT the important thing to note is that Shochu like sake DOES NOT UNDERGO THE MALTING PROCESS Instead of creating sugar via soaking drying germination you get a mold spore called Koji to do it for you In Japan Shochu aged in barrels is not synonymous with whisky that is a law Shochus are strictly regulated so much to the point where you can t have aged shochu be darker than a certain color but I don t have time to get into that So Barrel Aged Shochu whisky In Japan In the US you can call it whisky because it s a cereal grain aged in barrels Fukano and Ohishi are examples of this and are often referred to as Rice Whiskies but it s v v important to remember that the spirit making process is majorly different That being said when tasting these don t compare them to whisky That s not fair to the spirit If you need to compare it to anything think of it as distilled sake while also noting that the rice will not taste the same as a corn rye wheat whisk e y SOURCING WHISKY Y all Sourced Whisky Bad Whisky If there s a take home message here this is it Deception is never good but sourced whisky does not equate to bad whisky It definitely can be but that s not always true But alas deception and sourced whisky sadly usually are often times associated with each other Remember sourcing whisky has been around since the beginning of whisky making history If you are insistent that sourced bad I will immediately assume you just spew stuff that you ve been told without doing research And that s understandable because a lot of liquor brands use that as a marketing tool these days Scotch and Irish whiskies have a long history of sourcing and sharing whiskies And you ll see it in Canada and the US too Hell half the bourbon market comes from the midwest even though it says Kentucky Vermont Colorado etc on the label And it s situations like this where we see people jump to the conclusions that sourced whiskies are bad because they feel deceived and I don t blame them You tell Texans that Tito s Vodka is not made in Austin and they get defensive I get it Sourced whisky CAN be bad As I showcased in the last few sentences Deception sucks and we don t like being lied to But you know how I said Japanese whisky laws weren t put into place because no one thought it would become such big deal I imagine that happened with some brands too Let s say decades ago you started sourcing Indiana white dog and aging it at your warehouse most likely because you couldn t afford to set up a distillery because it s well REALLY expensive You probably didn t realize people would care so much years later The emphasis on craft products and authenticity has totally reshaped the whiskey market to where it is today People care now People want authentic products That s why you see more and more brands being transparent about sourcing because that s not going away From a financial standpoint many people have to source because it s the only economical option What the brand decides to do from there is on them There s exceptions to everything that I m saying but people need to realize all this before they go saying SOURCED IS BAD It can be Totally can But don t generalize cuz not everything is black and white Oversimplifying anything makes it easier to digest but understand that there s a lot more to sourcing than people are trying to trick you Not to mention your local distillery will probably use this as an easy lazy sales pitch to deter you away from the competition and you should support local all I m saying is that this is an easy sales pitch that I encounter all the time ANYWAY Back to Japan Here s where we see lots of examples of where sourced whisky can be bad Japan has no whisky laws so why not source a bunch of whisky teaspoon whatever Japanese distillate if we wanna be extra fancy and export that as Japanese Whisky We ll make a lot more money on selling scotch canadian whisky as Japanese whisky that way This is what s happening in the Japanese whisky world and this is very problematic Not only are you lying to people but you re straight up taking advantage of the hype and scarcity of Japanese whisky Again Japan didn t know Japanese whisky would get the insane hype that it s getting today which stems from all the recognitions World Whiskies Awards these Japanese whiskies received over the last decades so a lot of them ran out of stock It is aged spirit which takes time Also let s say you are one of the poor individuals that bought into one of these sourced Japanese whiskies Chances are it wasn t that great That gives Japanese whisky a bad name too If this happened to you didn t you think to yourself wow Japanese whisky is really overrated That sucked That s unfair to the real producers who are working hard to make delicious whiskies But if you did buy a sourced Japanese whisky and you liked it then great From a consumer perspective that s honestly what matters most in end When discussing sourced Japanese whiskies people often mention Matsui Shuzo When they started out in there was no physical distillery yet they had these age statement Kurayoshi whiskies ranging from years in age People also like to emphasize the fact that the packaging looks a lot like Suntory whiskies lol Anyway how are there age statement whiskies when there is no distillery Simple It was sourced from elsewhere it just has a Japanese looking label on it Matsui ended up getting a ton of heat for this so they eventually built a distillery Though they are releasing their own stuff now under Matsui Whisky they are calling the new whiskies Single Malts despite being less than a year old Again no law to stop them but the respectable distilleries would refer to this as a New Born whisky which is anything under than years old according to TWSC As I mentioned earlier respectable distilleries follow scotch laws We see new producers like Akkeshi and Kanosuke releasing their newer single malts as New Born whiskies So if this is bad sourced whisky what the heck is good sourced whisky Obviously this is all subjective but in my eyes good sourced whisky sourced whisky that is being used as a tool This is the example I always use Nikka by the Barrel Won from Whisky Advocate a couple years ago Nikka is one of the OG distilleries and the founder is one of the reasons why Japanese whiskies exists today Nikka owns main Japanese Whisky distilleries Yoichi and Miyagikyo if you haven t tried these you are missing out They also own Ben Nevis Distillery in Scotland Nikka by the Barrel from my understanding is a blend of Nikka Japanese whisky and Ben Nevis scotch whisky To me this is a prime example of good sourced whisky it s being used as a tool to achieve an intentional desired flavor profile And based on these whisky subreddits yall love this stuff Another example is Mars Distillery They make plenty of their own whiskies but they have a line called Lucky Cat From my understanding they use sourced whiskies as a tool to achieve a certain flavor profile that they can t meet on their own The Lucky Cat whiskies are named after individual cats owned by the President of Mars Distillery and each whisky flavor profile is carefully curated to match the cat s personality it s super wholesome and cute There s also only a couple thousand bottles of each SKU made so I assume it s more of a fun homage to the pets not deception Meanwhile Suntory owns Laphroaig Auchentoshan Bowmore etc they use some scotch for Ao their world whisky which imo is a blatant knockoff of Ichiro s Malt Malt Grain lol Punch Magazine recently wrote an article about this concept too It s very hard to distinguish who s doing it for experimentation vs who s just trying to profit It s based off your personal research knowledge and interpretation I see that Nommunication post being circulated all the time and it s a decent guide My big issue with it that the author who does his research and he s VERY informative please don t get me wrong doesn t really address the issue with sourcing It s either it s good bc it s entirely made in Japan or it s sourced and bad If you read anything I typed above I think this simplified narrative leaves out a lot of important information and curates this unnecessary negativity towards a topic that is very much so ingrained in the history of whisky making If you follow his blog as much as I do there s more that is revealed but I usually see people treating this graphic as the Japanese whisky bible It s not I actually was grabbing a bottle of Mars Iwai off the shelf a few years back and the guy working at the liquor store told me that was fake Japanese whisky referring to the initial infographic that was made Me knowing a lot about Japanese whisky challenged this idea and explained to him that this was definitely made in Nagano at a legit distillery Someone later corrected the author and he made the nd chart But that s super unfair to Mars considering they did nothing wrong not to mention a newer variation of this whisky was listed in Whisky Advocate s top last year But I don t blame anyone because as I keep emphasizing there s not much info on Japanese whiskies in general That being said this chart is almost correct to my knowledge at least Some mistakes I see are Kaiyo being labeled as authentic Japanese whisky it s definitely not Akashi being labeled as inauthentic the one that is exported to the US is the Japanese version has molasses I think therefore its not Yamazakura was sourced at one point and no longer is Again there s so much change happening and smoke in mirrors that this sort of thing is totally inevitable Also this chart doesn t define Japanese whisky Which is fair because as we determined there is no real definition for it but he did have to categorize these somehow to create the chart I d like to know if it was sorted by things like has a distillery age statement is X etc Also we don t know which producers are being transparent or not For example the Kaiyo whisky has multiple evolving stories that defend why it s authentic it s not despite the defensive arguments Another example which is entirely my speculation I have no proof I don t think SOME of the Suntory and Nikka whiskies are Japanese distillate anymore With the insane demand especially now there s no way they can keep up Nikka recently underwent a recipe change for Taketsuru Pure Malt which is where my theory came about I speculate whether Toki is truly Japanese because well it s not impressive lol I know it s just really young Anyway this chart is very helpful and this is just me ranting but my point keeps being it s not all black and white there are exceptions and explanations for everything JAPANESE WHISKY HISTORY Let s start with the OG Crew Shinjiro Torii Founder of Suntory Distillery est Masataka Taketsuru Founder of Nikka Distillery est also co founded Suntory Distillery Kiichiro Iwai Founder of Mars Distillery est Masataka Taketsuru s mentor and Taketsuru was at one point engaged to Iwai s daughter This is the lore that I was taught from several sources whom are affiliated with these brands The first ever introduction to whisky is when Commodore Perry brings it as a gift to Japan during the Meiji Era By the end of the shogunate in the Japanese are aware of western liquor How it s made No idea However Japan is making shochu which is their own distilled spirit during this time distilled once in pot stills Column stills were imported into Japan in the very early s The year is and whisky is still a mystery in terms of how it s made A man by the name of Kiichiro Iwai is interested in creating authentic whisky and sends his about to be son in law at the time Masataka Taketsuru to Scotland where he would study at various establishments University of Glasgow Bo Ness Distillery Longmorn Hazelburn among others He stayed with a Scottish host family there the Cowans and took detailed reports on his findings and observations of whisky making which eventually became the Taketsuru Note Taketsuru returned to Japan in with all the information they needed to open a whisky distillery in addition to his new wife Rita one of the daughters of the Cowan host family This eventually led to a falling out with the Iwai family Meanwhile another legend by the name of Shinjiro Torii was specializing in the world of exported spirits During WWI the Japanese economy flourished and in came an influx of western liquor and Mr Torii had a growing interest in foreign booze especially wine and brandy His growing curiosity for spirits paired with an accidental encounter of spirits left in a barrel led to his desire to open a whisky distillery But there was no one who knew how to make whisky like the Europeans until now How did all these gentlemen meet One thing s for sure they all are affiliated with Settsu Shuzo a company specializing in industrial commercial and western style liquor Iwai worked here for many years before becoming for an advisor for Hombo Shuzo a company specializing in various wines and spirits now famously known as Mars Distillery Taketsuru also worked here as a chemist after Iwai introduced him to the owner of Settsu Shuzo Torii was one of Iwai s clients who was purchasing supplies for his own experiments Super small world Fast forward to Taketsuru is employed under Mr Torii and they open up Japan s first ever whisky distillery Suntory Yamazaki Taketsuru eventually branched off to open his own distillery in northern Japan where the climate is more similar to Scotland called Nikka Yoichi Mr Iwai who owned the rights to the Taketsuru Note helped the Hombo family open Mars Distillery in The rest is history So who s legit The common theme of this whole post is there is no official definition so we have to keep defining things ourselves There s legitimate in that they have a real distillery proper permits making their own whiskies etc And there s legit which is the term I decided to coin for this reddit post as anyone who has a physical distillery in Japan with the intention of making authentic product aka who do I respect and who s whisky will I support and drink How do you draw the line of who has good intentions without the brand making a statement about it talking to the producers themselves finding skeletons in a closet and realizing that it was just marketing to sell sourced whisky All of this is subjective in concept and limited to my knowledge of the distilleries my respect for a distillery could change entirely based on what I learn over time Legitimate Producers companies with physical distilleries Possibility of previously sourced whiskies but are making product of their own now Nikka Ichiro s Malt Chichibu Akashi Eigashima White Oak Mars Kanosuke Akkeshi Suntory Fuiji Gotemba Shizuoka Okayama Nukada Asaka Saburomaru Wakatsuru hopefully I m not forgetting anyone Some of these do not export out of Japan just FYI No one asked but my favorites Nikka Ichiro s Malt Chichibu Akashi Eigashima White Oak Mars Kanosuke Akkeshi Suntory in no special order While not whisky I do support Fukano rice shochu and Ohishi rice shochu too In case you re wondering why support rice shochu being marketed as whisky That s because I take their shochu history into consideration These are some very well respected producers in Kumamoto especially Ohishi and make some wonderful products I initially thought they were sketch because well I technically don t consider it to be whisky bc the Koji yet it s being sold as whisky But coming from a liquor background it makes sense to import it as whisky to appeal to the American market because by US law it is a whisky even though it s not in Japan And if someone imported the same thing but had aged shochu written on the label I assure you almost no one would buy it because it s too foreign and no one knows what shochu is But it s similar enough to whisky that if someone who likes whisky tried it they might like it You might learn later that it s a shochu but now you know you like shochu As a Japanese person I have a bias towards supporting Japanese products so I want people to get into shochu It s a weird cool thing that gets overshadowed by whisky and sake Is this deceiving Yes totally and I can see why it might be hard to understand my justification for it given everything else that I ve said But I see this more of a ask for forgiveness not permission opportunity that can open up an entirely new category of spirits that you otherwise would have never tried What do yall think Am I leaving everything too vague I want to hear your thoughts on this topic from all perspectives of the whisk e y world,1,A Discussion About Sourced Whisk e y Japanese Whisky This wonderful gent over at r WhiskeyTribe made this fun info graph and I offered to share what I know about Japanese whisky It took me a long time to write so I figured I d share and open up a discussion on sourced whiskies I wanted to paint an entire picture for you before you go making a chart that people start relying on It s important to note a lot of things that get overly simplified probably because there s not too much info out there If you d like to learn more about legit Japanese whisky producers on an individual level feel free to ask didn t go into it for the sake of time Whisky Rising by Stefan Van Eycken and The Way of Whisky by Dave Broom are amazing resources for anyone that wants to learn more JP WHISKY LAWS First thing to note making whisky is Japan is a very vague concept Japan has officially been making whisky for less than years Before that it was trial and error and honestly nothing similar to what we would define as whisky today Additionally who knew Japanese whisky would blow up in the way that it did Now that is has we have people who ARE making whisky and we have even more people who have found loopholes and are selling sourced whisky AS Japanese whisky It is very hard to draw the line of who s making whisky for right wrong reasons and this is probably why the Japanese government hasn t really done anything about it But now we have Whisky Associations that are stepping up to make this change themselves The Tokyo Whisky and Spirits Competition is organized by them and if you want to enter you must follow their requirements Mashing of the grain and saccharification without Koji see Shochu Vs Whisky paragraph fermentation distillation and year aging must all take place in Japan Blending or bottling can take place outside of Japan which is interesting The only real law regarding Japanese whisky is your establishment needs to have a whisky license Which just means that you can house whisky doesn t emphasize on the production aspect But even though there are no laws the respectable Japanese whisky distillers typically follow scotch law Aged min years min ABV and obv made in Japan Your current definition of Japanese whisky that you put in the new graph says Whisky distilled from cereal grains Aged in wooden barrels I believe this is the US s definition of whisky This comes into play when we look at the aged shochu category aka Rice Whisky SHOCHU VS WHISKY Real quick ELI think of shochu as distilled sake brewed rice beverage that has ABV similar to wine Except it can be made with any grain barley potato rice sugarcane buckwheat and some ppl also use unique things like tomatoes It can be distilled once or twice BUT the important thing to note is that Shochu like sake DOES NOT UNDERGO THE MALTING PROCESS Instead of creating sugar via soaking drying germination you get a mold spore called Koji to do it for you In Japan Shochu aged in barrels is not synonymous with whisky that is a law Shochus are strictly regulated so much to the point where you can t have aged shochu be darker than a certain color but I don t have time to get into that So Barrel Aged Shochu whisky In Japan In the US you can call it whisky because it s a cereal grain aged in barrels Fukano and Ohishi are examples of this and are often referred to as Rice Whiskies but it s v v important to remember that the spirit making process is majorly different That being said when tasting these don t compare them to whisky That s not fair to the spirit If you need to compare it to anything think of it as distilled sake while also noting that the rice will not taste the same as a corn rye wheat whisk e y SOURCING WHISKY Y all Sourced Whisky Bad Whisky If there s a take home message here this is it Deception is never good but sourced whisky does not equate to bad whisky It definitely can be but that s not always true But alas deception and sourced whisky sadly usually are often times associated with each other Remember sourcing whisky has been around since the beginning of whisky making history If you are insistent that sourced bad I will immediately assume you just spew stuff that you ve been told without doing research And that s understandable because a lot of liquor brands use that as a marketing tool these days Scotch and Irish whiskies have a long history of sourcing and sharing whiskies And you ll see it in Canada and the US too Hell half the bourbon market comes from the midwest even though it says Kentucky Vermont Colorado etc on the label And it s situations like this where we see people jump to the conclusions that sourced whiskies are bad because they feel deceived and I don t blame them You tell Texans that Tito s Vodka is not made in Austin and they get defensive I get it Sourced whisky CAN be bad As I showcased in the last few sentences Deception sucks and we don t like being lied to But you know how I said Japanese whisky laws weren t put into place because no one thought it would become such big deal I imagine that happened with some brands too Let s say decades ago you started sourcing Indiana white dog and aging it at your warehouse most likely because you couldn t afford to set up a distillery because it s well REALLY expensive You probably didn t realize people would care so much years later The emphasis on craft products and authenticity has totally reshaped the whiskey market to where it is today People care now People want authentic products That s why you see more and more brands being transparent about sourcing because that s not going away From a financial standpoint many people have to source because it s the only economical option What the brand decides to do from there is on them There s exceptions to everything that I m saying but people need to realize all this before they go saying SOURCED IS BAD It can be Totally can But don t generalize cuz not everything is black and white Oversimplifying anything makes it easier to digest but understand that there s a lot more to sourcing than people are trying to trick you Not to mention your local distillery will probably use this as an easy lazy sales pitch to deter you away from the competition and you should support local all I m saying is that this is an easy sales pitch that I encounter all the time ANYWAY Back to Japan Here s where we see lots of examples of where sourced whisky can be bad Japan has no whisky laws so why not source a bunch of whisky teaspoon whatever Japanese distillate if we wanna be extra fancy and export that as Japanese Whisky We ll make a lot more money on selling scotch canadian whisky as Japanese whisky that way This is what s happening in the Japanese whisky world and this is very problematic Not only are you lying to people but you re straight up taking advantage of the hype and scarcity of Japanese whisky Again Japan didn t know Japanese whisky would get the insane hype that it s getting today which stems from all the recognitions World Whiskies Awards these Japanese whiskies received over the last decades so a lot of them ran out of stock It is aged spirit which takes time Also let s say you are one of the poor individuals that bought into one of these sourced Japanese whiskies Chances are it wasn t that great That gives Japanese whisky a bad name too If this happened to you didn t you think to yourself wow Japanese whisky is really overrated That sucked That s unfair to the real producers who are working hard to make delicious whiskies But if you did buy a sourced Japanese whisky and you liked it then great From a consumer perspective that s honestly what matters most in end When discussing sourced Japanese whiskies people often mention Matsui Shuzo When they started out in there was no physical distillery yet they had these age statement Kurayoshi whiskies ranging from years in age People also like to emphasize the fact that the packaging looks a lot like Suntory whiskies lol Anyway how are there age statement whiskies when there is no distillery Simple It was sourced from elsewhere it just has a Japanese looking label on it Matsui ended up getting a ton of heat for this so they eventually built a distillery Though they are releasing their own stuff now under Matsui Whisky they are calling the new whiskies Single Malts despite being less than a year old Again no law to stop them but the respectable distilleries would refer to this as a New Born whisky which is anything under than years old according to TWSC As I mentioned earlier respectable distilleries follow scotch laws We see new producers like Akkeshi and Kanosuke releasing their newer single malts as New Born whiskies So if this is bad sourced whisky what the heck is good sourced whisky Obviously this is all subjective but in my eyes good sourced whisky sourced whisky that is being used as a tool This is the example I always use Nikka by the Barrel Won from Whisky Advocate a couple years ago Nikka is one of the OG distilleries and the founder is one of the reasons why Japanese whiskies exists today Nikka owns main Japanese Whisky distilleries Yoichi and Miyagikyo if you haven t tried these you are missing out They also own Ben Nevis Distillery in Scotland Nikka by the Barrel from my understanding is a blend of Nikka Japanese whisky and Ben Nevis scotch whisky To me this is a prime example of good sourced whisky it s being used as a tool to achieve an intentional desired flavor profile And based on these whisky subreddits yall love this stuff Another example is Mars Distillery They make plenty of their own whiskies but they have a line called Lucky Cat From my understanding they use sourced whiskies as a tool to achieve a certain flavor profile that they can t meet on their own The Lucky Cat whiskies are named after individual cats owned by the President of Mars Distillery and each whisky flavor profile is carefully curated to match the cat s personality it s super wholesome and cute There s also only a couple thousand bottles of each SKU made so I assume it s more of a fun homage to the pets not deception Meanwhile Suntory owns Laphroaig Auchentoshan Bowmore etc they use some scotch for Ao their world whisky which imo is a blatant knockoff of Ichiro s Malt Malt Grain lol Punch Magazine recently wrote an article about this concept too It s very hard to distinguish who s doing it for experimentation vs who s just trying to profit It s based off your personal research knowledge and interpretation I see that Nommunication post being circulated all the time and it s a decent guide My big issue with it that the author who does his research and he s VERY informative please don t get me wrong doesn t really address the issue with sourcing It s either it s good bc it s entirely made in Japan or it s sourced and bad If you read anything I typed above I think this simplified narrative leaves out a lot of important information and curates this unnecessary negativity towards a topic that is very much so ingrained in the history of whisky making If you follow his blog as much as I do there s more that is revealed but I usually see people treating this graphic as the Japanese whisky bible It s not I actually was grabbing a bottle of Mars Iwai off the shelf a few years back and the guy working at the liquor store told me that was fake Japanese whisky referring to the initial infographic that was made Me knowing a lot about Japanese whisky challenged this idea and explained to him that this was definitely made in Nagano at a legit distillery Someone later corrected the author and he made the nd chart But that s super unfair to Mars considering they did nothing wrong not to mention a newer variation of this whisky was listed in Whisky Advocate s top last year But I don t blame anyone because as I keep emphasizing there s not much info on Japanese whiskies in general That being said this chart is almost correct to my knowledge at least Some mistakes I see are Kaiyo being labeled as authentic Japanese whisky it s definitely not Akashi being labeled as inauthentic the one that is exported to the US is the Japanese version has molasses I think therefore its not Yamazakura was sourced at one point and no longer is Again there s so much change happening and smoke in mirrors that this sort of thing is totally inevitable Also this chart doesn t define Japanese whisky Which is fair because as we determined there is no real definition for it but he did have to categorize these somehow to create the chart I d like to know if it was sorted by things like has a distillery age statement is X etc Also we don t know which producers are being transparent or not For example the Kaiyo whisky has multiple evolving stories that defend why it s authentic it s not despite the defensive arguments Another example which is entirely my speculation I have no proof I don t think SOME of the Suntory and Nikka whiskies are Japanese distillate anymore With the insane demand especially now there s no way they can keep up Nikka recently underwent a recipe change for Taketsuru Pure Malt which is where my theory came about I speculate whether Toki is truly Japanese because well it s not impressive lol I know it s just really young Anyway this chart is very helpful and this is just me ranting but my point keeps being it s not all black and white there are exceptions and explanations for everything JAPANESE WHISKY HISTORY Let s start with the OG Crew Shinjiro Torii Founder of Suntory Distillery est Masataka Taketsuru Founder of Nikka Distillery est also co founded Suntory Distillery Kiichiro Iwai Founder of Mars Distillery est Masataka Taketsuru s mentor and Taketsuru was at one point engaged to Iwai s daughter This is the lore that I was taught from several sources whom are affiliated with these brands The first ever introduction to whisky is when Commodore Perry brings it as a gift to Japan during the Meiji Era By the end of the shogunate in the Japanese are aware of western liquor How it s made No idea However Japan is making shochu which is their own distilled spirit during this time distilled once in pot stills Column stills were imported into Japan in the very early s The year is and whisky is still a mystery in terms of how it s made A man by the name of Kiichiro Iwai is interested in creating authentic whisky and sends his about to be son in law at the time Masataka Taketsuru to Scotland where he would study at various establishments University of Glasgow Bo Ness Distillery Longmorn Hazelburn among others He stayed with a Scottish host family there the Cowans and took detailed reports on his findings and observations of whisky making which eventually became the Taketsuru Note Taketsuru returned to Japan in with all the information they needed to open a whisky distillery in addition to his new wife Rita one of the daughters of the Cowan host family This eventually led to a falling out with the Iwai family Meanwhile another legend by the name of Shinjiro Torii was specializing in the world of exported spirits During WWI the Japanese economy flourished and in came an influx of western liquor and Mr Torii had a growing interest in foreign booze especially wine and brandy His growing curiosity for spirits paired with an accidental encounter of spirits left in a barrel led to his desire to open a whisky distillery But there was no one who knew how to make whisky like the Europeans until now How did all these gentlemen meet One thing s for sure they all are affiliated with Settsu Shuzo a company specializing in industrial commercial and western style liquor Iwai worked here for many years before becoming for an advisor for Hombo Shuzo a company specializing in various wines and spirits now famously known as Mars Distillery Taketsuru also worked here as a chemist after Iwai introduced him to the owner of Settsu Shuzo Torii was one of Iwai s clients who was purchasing supplies for his own experiments Super small world Fast forward to Taketsuru is employed under Mr Torii and they open up Japan s first ever whisky distillery Suntory Yamazaki Taketsuru eventually branched off to open his own distillery in northern Japan where the climate is more similar to Scotland called Nikka Yoichi Mr Iwai who owned the rights to the Taketsuru Note helped the Hombo family open Mars Distillery in The rest is history So who s legit The common theme of this whole post is there is no official definition so we have to keep defining things ourselves There s legitimate in that they have a real distillery proper permits making their own whiskies etc And there s legit which is the term I decided to coin for this reddit post as anyone who has a physical distillery in Japan with the intention of making authentic product aka who do I respect and who s whisky will I support and drink How do you draw the line of who has good intentions without the brand making a statement about it talking to the producers themselves finding skeletons in a closet and realizing that it was just marketing to sell sourced whisky All of this is subjective in concept and limited to my knowledge of the distilleries my respect for a distillery could change entirely based on what I learn over time Legitimate Producers companies with physical distilleries Possibility of previously sourced whiskies but are making product of their own now Nikka Ichiro s Malt Chichibu Akashi Eigashima White Oak Mars Kanosuke Akkeshi Suntory Fuiji Gotemba Shizuoka Okayama Nukada Asaka Saburomaru Wakatsuru hopefully I m not forgetting anyone Some of these do not export out of Japan just FYI No one asked but my favorites Nikka Ichiro s Malt Chichibu Akashi Eigashima White Oak Mars Kanosuke Akkeshi Suntory in no special order While not whisky I do support Fukano rice

Review Glendalough Year Porter Finished Irish Whiskey, I have always enjoyed whiskey and have started really diving deep into whiskey for about a year now After starting with different things from rye to bourbon to scotch buying one bottle at a time it took me about a full year to really be able to pick up notes that are recognizable enough to write a review so here it goes all feedback is appreciated on anything I could improve for the next post Color Fairly light in between a dark bourbon and lighter scotch Nose chocolate covered fruits slightly rubbery bright walnuts almost like a tootsie pop with the sugar fruit and somewhat fake chocolate Pallet much of the same with bright chocolate desert fruits reminds me of an edible arrangement slightly malty very similar to the nose just much more intense very good oily mouth feel Finish dry oak then finishes with a brightness and slight char at the same time not peat smoke but a char or burnt taste similar to a porter rounding out almost bitter like dark chocolate and very long for ABV Overall I chose to do this as my first whiskey review because it surprised me so much I am usually a bourbon drinker and this is nothing like bourbon and I appreciate how it is unique and approachable The mix of flavors is unique and it really has great finish for a middle of the road ABV It does feel a little disjointed and the char flavor or bitterness almost comes across as ashy cigar taste and does linger in a strange way for such a bright whiskey I recommend keeping this in the home bar if you have a decent collection and it could be a daily drinker but I see it more as an exploration whiskey to share with others Rating Great buy for the price ,1,Review Glendalough Year Porter Finished Irish Whiskey  I have always enjoyed whiskey and have started really diving deep into whiskey for about a year now After starting with different things from rye to bourbon to scotch buying one bottle at a time it took me about a full year to really be able to pick up notes that are recognizable enough to write a review so here it goes all feedback is appreciated on anything I could improve for the next post Color Fairly light in between a dark bourbon and lighter scotch Nose chocolate covered fruits slightly rubbery bright walnuts almost like a tootsie pop with the sugar fruit and somewhat fake chocolate Pallet much of the same with bright chocolate desert fruits reminds me of an edible arrangement slightly malty very similar to the nose just much more intense very good oily mouth feel Finish dry oak then finishes with a brightness and slight char at the same time not peat smoke but a char or burnt taste similar to a porter rounding out almost bitter like dark chocolate and very long for ABV Overall I chose to do this as my first whiskey review because it surprised me so much I am usually a bourbon drinker and this is nothing like bourbon and I appreciate how it is unique and approachable The mix of flavors is unique and it really has great finish for a middle of the road ABV It does feel a little disjointed and the char flavor or bitterness almost comes across as ashy cigar taste and does linger in a strange way for such a bright whiskey I recommend keeping this in the home bar if you have a decent collection and it could be a daily drinker but I see it more as an exploration whiskey to share with others Rating Great buy for the price

First time posting here any recommendations for bottles to gift ,Hi Please excuse this post delete if I m asking this question in the incorrect place My partner is a budding fan of whiskey and his birthday is coming up I secretly purchased a bar cart he s been eyeing and feel that it would be best to present it to him along with a new bottle of whiskey or two Long and short we live in Seattle and it s not in my best interest to go on a scavenger hunt for rare bottles at this time However I d still like to get him something to go along with the cart Bevmo Total Wine and Costco are still open for in store shopping curbside pick up Considering these are the places I will most likely shop at are there any recommendations you can make As for his preferences I m honestly not sure I know nothing about whiskey and fortunately for me he has never asked me to partake in this interest with him If it s helpful at all some bottles he currently has on the kitchen counter are I ll just write out what I see on the label Nikka Whiskey From the Barrel Kavalan single malt Dalwhinnie Winter s Frost Glenfiddich Glenfiddich Redbreast He has a bunch of his finished bottles stored away in one of the high kitchen cupboards I can t dig through it because we are both currently wfh and he will definitely hear the ruckus I make trying to climb up there Hopefully the few he has out is somewhat helpful in making some recommendations He is not an avid purchaser so I think any decent recommendation will do Honestly anything helps Thank you in advance ,1,First time posting here any recommendations for bottles to gift  Hi Please excuse this post delete if I m asking this question in the incorrect place My partner is a budding fan of whiskey and his birthday is coming up I secretly purchased a bar cart he s been eyeing and feel that it would be best to present it to him along with a new bottle of whiskey or two Long and short we live in Seattle and it s not in my best interest to go on a scavenger hunt for rare bottles at this time However I d still like to get him something to go along with the cart Bevmo Total Wine and Costco are still open for in store shopping curbside pick up Considering these are the places I will most likely shop at are there any recommendations you can make As for his preferences I m honestly not sure I know nothing about whiskey and fortunately for me he has never asked me to partake in this interest with him If it s helpful at all some bottles he currently has on the kitchen counter are I ll just write out what I see on the label Nikka Whiskey From the Barrel Kavalan single malt Dalwhinnie Winter s Frost Glenfiddich Glenfiddich Redbreast He has a bunch of his finished bottles stored away in one of the high kitchen cupboards I can t dig through it because we are both currently wfh and he will definitely hear the ruckus I make trying to climb up there Hopefully the few he has out is somewhat helpful in making some recommendations He is not an avid purchaser so I think any decent recommendation will do Honestly anything helps Thank you in advance

Larceny Barrel Proof A Review,Larceny Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey Batch A Posted on April by Chris Newell The older and stronger brother of Heaven Hill s latest wheated bourbon Larceny is getting a jump in both proof and availability from years past The A batch is the first of three annual releases from Heaven Hill for their barrel proof wheated bourbon Following in the footsteps of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof new batches of Larceny Barrel Proof will be released in January May and September of each year Each release will have a corresponding letter A B or C and number which represents the month and year of the release Ex A is January B is the May release etc Each release will differ in proof with age remaining in the year range Class Straight Bourbon Whiskey Distillery Heaven Hill Age NAS Rumored six to eight year old bourbon Mashbill Corn Wheat Malted Barley Proof MSRP The Review Nose First dive into the glass emits an immediate punch of brown sugar and rich almost molasses like syrup fills the nostrils For being almost proof the alcohol punch and ethanol burn is more minimal than what I expected A subtle mesh of orange peel and dark dried fruits come through next followed by very light notes of oak and barrel tannins Overall this is a very sweet and pleasant nose but nothing overly complex Taste Immediately the Larceny wheated profile comes through for me on initial sip Notes of fresh baked bread and cinnamon glide across the front and center of the palate That classic Heaven Hill toasted caramel drizzled almond note shows up on the center of the tongue This is drinking far smoother than the proof would suggest The oak is more prevalent than on the nose but the immense sweetness is the most dominant note from start to finish Mouthfeel Finish The mouthfeel is decent but not near as coating or viscous as I would have hoped for from a barrel proof expression The flavors are consistent from start to finish but it has a medium finish overall Overall Impression If you are a fan of the base Larceny you will not be disappointed in the A barrel proof offering especially at This is a very nice cask strength bourbon at an affordable price I do feel there are superior expressions very near this price range and I would have no problem jumping up to to get an Elijah Craig Barrel Proof ECBP or Old Forester instead Similar to the Elijah Craig Barrel Proof expressions for me personally I am expecting bigger and better things from the next two releases of The C batches of ECBP have consistently been my favorite releases over the past few years and I am curious to see if the Larceny Barrel Proof follows the same trend Maximum Price I Would Pay Bourbinsane Breakdown ,1,Larceny Barrel Proof A Review Larceny Barrel Proof

Review Booker s Shiny Barrel Batch, About the Spirit Booker s Shiny Barrel Batch is the second batch of and its name was taken from a tradition that took place in years past when rackhouse employees would sneak tastes of bourbon out from selected barrels In doing so it would cause the dust to be removed from these barrels when their bellies would rub up against them These now shiny barrels from the center of the rackhouse would be where the good stuff was located making it easy for Booker Noe to select what to bottle for his namesake bourbon This batch has the lowest abv of all the Booker s

whiskey could be better by using the Japanese way of business kaizen Booker s brand in particular was named for Jim Beam s distiller emeritus and grandson Booker Noe who hand selected the barrels to be used in future Booker s batches Originally the bourbon was taken straight out of the barrels by Noe and given to family and friends as gifts but eventually made for public purchase in the late s

Monkey shoulder inconsistent taste ,Has anyone else experienced wild inconsistencies with different bottles with this blend I bought my first bottle half a year ago and absolutely loved it Smelled fresh fruity like orange marmalade with notes of banana and almonds marzipan Was and still is my favorite whiskey to date Last week I was flying back to Canada and picked up a L bottle from the duty free in Frankfurt extremely excited to drink it once Im back BOY what a disappointment Literally tastes like a completely different whiskey This one smells like malt cereal with maybe a touch of honey Nowhere near as smooth as I remember and tastes straight up flat and boring I thought it was just me so I asked my dad if he thought the same thing and he completely agreed that it tasted like a different whiskey He said went as far as to check the batch number on the bottle and as we later found out it s not a real batch number but an homage to the original batch size Has anyone else experienced anything similar ,1,Monkey shoulder inconsistent taste  Has anyone else experienced wild inconsistencies with different bottles with this blend I bought my first bottle half a year ago and absolutely loved it Smelled fresh fruity like orange marmalade with notes of banana and almonds marzipan Was and still is my favorite whiskey to date Last week I was flying back to Canada and picked up a L bottle from the duty free in Frankfurt extremely excited to drink it once Im back BOY what a disappointment Literally tastes like a completely different whiskey This one smells like malt cereal with maybe a touch of honey Nowhere near as smooth as I remember and tastes straight up flat and boring I thought it was just me so I asked my dad if he thought the same thing and he completely agreed that it tasted like a different whiskey He said went as far as to check the batch number on the bottle and as we later found out it s not a real batch number but an homage to the original batch size Has anyone else experienced anything similar

Review High West s A Midwinter Nights Dram Act Scene ,Fall is here in Georgia finally Those degree days are gone and we re met with mild temperatures and cool breezes Today in particular was just a rainy cool lazy Sunday and I had a craving for a pour of something that matched the weather and my mood What better drink to start off Autumn with than High West s A Midwinter Nights Dram This is one of my favorite fall winter pours and is a perfect whiskey for sitting outside in the cool weather and just taking in a bit of nature as you sip away on this pleasant rye blend MWND is one of High West s special releases each year and is a blend of their Rendezvous Rye whiskey that has been finished in French Oak port barrels The Act denotes the year of production and the Scene denotes the bottling batch i e Act is the th year they ve produced MWND and Scene is the first batch produced this year Unlike Basil Hayden s Dark Rye this is how rye finished in port should be done The whiskey first and foremost both smells and tastes like rye and then you get a bit of the port barrel influence that adds a fruity sweetness to an already pleasant rye The nose is rich with rye spice dried fruits from the port barrel and Christmas spices like cinnamon and nutmeg The palate is sweet with vanilla caramel and rye spices There are hints of cinnamon and dark fruits as well followed by a long and warm finish with the rye spice and cinnamon sweetness lingering on the tongue img Doing a quick taste test comparing the bottle to last year s release Act squeaks out ahead of last year s ever so slightly There s a deeper richness to this year s release and I m not sure if that can be attributed to oxidization of my Act since it s been open a year or if there really is more flavor in this years release The basic flavor profile is on point with both pours but Act is just a tiny bit sweeter and richer I d still take a bottle of either if offered so take that for what you will MWND is a very well balanced rye that pairs well with crisp cool weather and cloudy days I would highly recommend this bottle to anyone that wants a unique rye experience or just wants to try something different This could be a gateway whiskey for the wine fan in your life as it s rather accessible at proof and could be brought a bit lower with a few drops of water and still remain faithful to its flavor profile MSRP on this bottle is here in Georgia and I think while that s a bit steep it s a fair price for this delicious bottle I had to call several stores to get one for with many charging as much as for the handful of bottles they received which I personally don t think is worth the markup However it seemed much easier to find this year so I don t know if production went up or if allocation in Georgia went up Either way I like that I was able to find one with relative ease this year even a week or two after they hit the state distribution If you can find one for close to retail I would recommend giving it a try I don t think you will be disappointed If you enjoyed this review find more like it at Woodstock Whiskey Society ,1,Review High West s A Midwinter Nights Dram Act Scene  Fall

you get a bit of the port barrel influence that adds a fruity sweetness to an already pleasant rye The nose is rich with rye spice dried fruits from the port barrel and Christmas spices like cinnamon and nutmeg The palate is sweet with vanilla caramel and rye spices There are hints of cinnamon and dark fruits as well followed by a long and warm finish with the rye spice and cinnamon sweetness lingering on the tongue img Doing a quick taste test comparing the bottle to last year s release Act squeaks out ahead of last year s ever so slightly There s a deeper richness to this year s release and I m not sure if that can be attributed to oxidization of my Act since it s been open a year or if there really is more flavor in this years release The basic flavor profile is on point with both pours but Act is just a tiny bit sweeter and richer I d still take a bottle of either if offered so take that for what you will MWND is a very well balanced rye that pairs well with crisp cool weather and cloudy days I would highly recommend this bottle to anyone that wants a unique rye experience or just wants to try something different This could be a gateway whiskey for the wine fan in your life as it s rather accessible at proof and could be brought a bit lower with a few drops of water and still remain faithful to its flavor profile MSRP on this bottle is here in Georgia and I think while that s a bit steep it s a fair price for this delicious bottle I had to call several stores to get one for with many charging as much as for the handful of bottles they received which I personally don t think is worth the markup However it seemed much easier to find this year so I don t know if production went up or if allocation in Georgia went up Either way I like that I was able to find one with relative ease this year even a week or two after they hit the state distribution If you can find one for close to retail I would recommend giving it a try I don t think you will be disappointed If you enjoyed this review find more like it at Woodstock Whiskey Society

My Trip to Hakushu Distillery,I traveled to Japan earlier this year and visited a few distilleries I haven t had a chance to type this up and format it correctly but I did get some time to do it now This is my review experience when visiting the distilleries I have also reviewed some of the whiskies that I have tasted while visiting the distilleries For my distillery trips To and from Hakashu from Tokyo To Kirin from Tokyo then headed to Kyoto To Yamazaki from Kyoto then headed to Osaka You can find the reviews of all the whiskies I tried here My journey begins in Tokyo and luckily I can take the train from Tokyo to the distillery Before heading to Japan I did a search on HyperDia for the prices of the ticket and the train line this is important and how to get there I also had a JR Pass so I need to keep an eye on the train line to make sure that I get a reserved seat for both getting there and back I arrived at Shinjuku station and was a bit lost The signs have a bit of English but I needed to make sure the time was precise I ended up asking one of the platform agents and he showed me where to stand The total travel time of the journey is hrs Once boarded seated and the train started moving I took a look outside the window I like to see landscapes outside the city The countryside is amazing to see a great view of many farms rice and some grapes for Japanese wines I also had the opportunity to go towards the end of Sakura blossoms so I was able to see quite a number of trees with the flowers Mount Kita was fairly easy to see but on my journey it was a bit cloudy making Mount Fuji a bit of a challenge Once I arrived at Kobuchizawa station I realized that I didn t schedule it out well enough to grab the free shuttle bus to the distillery I ended up paying for the taxi ride to the distillery Not too bad but better planning could have avoided spending an extra CAD When I arrived at the distillery and went up to the counter there wasn t a line so I was able to get my pass for the distillery tour quickly Note that it s cash only for the entrance fee If you re going in a group the distillery staff will colour code your badge green can drink alcohol pink designated driver yellow under years old Once I got in I walked around the grounds for a little while before heading to the museum There was quite a bit of information on the history of Hakushu but also the efforts they have made to ensure the wildlife is preserved It took about min to get through the museum About min before my tour I requested for an English audio guide I didn t realize you could grab an app and listen to it on your phone I didn t have my headphones with me which would have made listening to the guide easier The tour guides did give me a loaner phone with the app but this was a bit clumsy taking pictures reading and listening can be cumbersome seriously the headphones would be really helpful If I had to do it again I d grab the app and use my headphones to listen without needing to hold up the guide to my head Anyway once I got the audio guide there s a test feature so I quickly did a test and got a sense of the audio guide Once set up we headed to the tasting room from the museum to get a brief orientation The orientation includes a taste of the fresh mountain water a video subtitled and a PowerPoint guide in English which you ll read the first pages for since the rest is for the tasting You don t need to listen to anything on the guide only when prompted by the guide What I found useful was the numbers on the wall If you see them turn on the audio guide immediately and you ll keep good pace with the group especially since the the tour is in Japanese I will admit the fumbling with the audio guide and camera was a pain You can take as many pictures as you want but make sure you keep up with the group You ll first head to the mashing building and learn about the ingredients and the distillation process While I was listening to the audio guide I can tell that the Hakushu distillery cares quite a bit about the water source and the environment They also go through the details of the other ingredients mainly the barley and peat used there s some peat around to touch and smell One interesting thing is the mash tun is the typical metal one but the fermentation tun is made of wood I was surprised by this but they justified it by noting it was easier to control the temperature with it I may have missed the exact quote from the audio guide We moved on to the distillation area but unfortunately they do not allow you in I was behind a glass wall so it was more of a see it and watch this video thing Next step in the tour maturation which was a bit away and they shuttle you in a bus At this point there is some optional listening on the audio guide which again talks about the wildlife around the distillery Again if the guide prompts you first or you see the number just start the audio Once I was shuttled to the warehouse I got an introduction to the casks and a few example ones and then walk into the storage room Upon first steps in I could tell it was massive It would be an understatement to say I was barely able to see the back walls It seems like Hakushu has adopted the American bourbon style of storing whiskey since they noted that where a barrel is stored affects the aging Once we was done looking at the warehouse we were shuttled back to the tasting room and finally taste something other than mountain water By the time I got back to the tasting room there weren t any modules in the audio guide so I handed it back to one of the guides at the tasting room In the tasting room everything will be set up tasting glasses and a fifth glass with ml of Hakushu NAS for the highball I was told to follow along to the slides and the guide on the tasting procedure that the master distiller does The tastings include the general whiskies that make up the Hakushu The slides include everything about the notes Once you get to the th glass with the blend I had some information on the pairings for the whiskey Finally the th glass the guide walked through creating a high ball the proper way i e Hakushu way Because the highball is a bit more in alcohol they provided various foods that can be paired with it During this time I took my time eating and drinking and filling out the feedback form Once I was done the guides offered some discounts at specific stores but I was told they were far Besides it was in Japanese and I don t think I d get too far with them If you were traveling Japan by car I d recommend finding out more about the discounts At the end the group will thank the guide and everyone heads on their own way Generally though everyone heads to the shop At the shop I was able to purchase a variety of souvenirs and some whiskey I decided to grab something I couldn t get in Canada one of the early blends Hakushu made I did a quick Reddit search and picked the one that seemed good Note that you can use credit cards in the gift shop Near the gift shop is the tasting bar I didn t get a chance to use it but when I took a brief look at the menu nothing seemed to jump out as special you can generally get these in Tokyo bars I had to leave to catch the shuttle bus to the train station so the tasting room and the restaurant were out of the question Heading back I reflected on the experience and wrote up some of my brief points on the tour I will note that I didn t get a proper lunch literally the only food I had was the food given at the tasting and should have grabbed something from or Family Mart In terms of buying alcohol I d recommend buying from a grocery store There s more selection available and ones that are better rated on r

Should you ever use expensive whiskey when making cocktails ,Hey I started buying and enjoying whiskey last year and I mostly drink it like it is without ice I do however really enjoy whiskey with lemon soda or ginger ale But for this purpose I always just get a regular Jameson bottle which is fairly cheap Is there any benefit or point to mixing cocktails like this with more expensive whiskey For reference a bottle of Jameson is about dollars where i live and when I refer to expensive whiskey I m generally talking about stuff that might be twice or thrice that price The idea I got was that the sodas taste is so strong that using more expensive whiskey would have little to none effect Any feedback appreciated D,1,Should you ever use expensive whiskey when making cocktails  Hey I started buying and enjoying whiskey last year and I mostly drink it like it is without ice I do however really enjoy whiskey with lemon soda or ginger ale But for this purpose I always just get a regular Jameson bottle which is fairly cheap Is there any benefit or point to mixing cocktails like this with more expensive whiskey For reference a bottle of Jameson is about dollars where i live and when I refer to expensive whiskey I m generally talking about stuff that might be twice or thrice that price The idea I got was that the sodas taste is so strong that using more expensive whiskey would have little to none effect Any feedback appreciated D

Old Forester Review,The latest and last addition to the Old Forester Whiskey Row series is another stellar example of the quality juice that s coming out of their distillery This was a bottle I was kind of interested in after having the Old Forester but was kind of waiting to see other reviews before I made my purchase I heard from a friend who just so happens to be a rep for Brown Forman products in Colorado that the that was out there now would be all that is available until later in Everyone must have been hearing the same news because it took me checking at or stores that I knew used to have it in order to find a bottle Coming from the Old Forester and really enjoying it I had high hopes for the It was a lower ABV at only proof but still respectable The gimmick with this particular release is that the bourbon is taken from its original barrel and then placed into a heavily charred barrel to finish The result is a full flavored bourbon with hints of charred oak On the nose I get oak and a very sweet vanilla note After consulting the tasting notes on their site I see that this is a buttercream frosting and it fits the description really well As an aside I like to reference the notes on the distiller s website to see if their descriptions match what I m getting Lots of times I feel like most of us can discern the overarching notes that we find in most bourbons like oak vanilla and caramel but the subtle notes are sometimes lost upon us or we know there s something else there but can t put our finger on it Many times with the tasting notes provided by the distiller they can nudge us into the right direction which may simply just be the power of suggestion or it could be that those notes really are there Anyway I digress The palate is very sweet almost candy like There s definite notes of oak and vanilla and it seems as though there s a taste of caramel but it s almost burnt It s not the rich and creamy caramel you d find in say Weller Special Reserve but almost like the taste of caramel you ve made on the stove and you ve waited just a few seconds too long before adding the cream I m sure this is part of the influence of the heavily charred barrel and I must say it is very nice The mouthfeel is viscous and coats the mouth a very welcome trait in my mind The finish is oak forward with the char from the barrel being quite noticeable There s a hint of cedar and then a nice long spicy finish This is quite the enjoyable pour but I still find myself to be more fond of the I typically gravitate more towards the higher proof whiskies so I may just be biased However at around the mark it s a very good bourbon and being lower proof and very sweet I would recommend this to a newcomer or someone with a sweet tooth All in all I d say this is a fine finish to the Whiskey Row series and I look forward to seeing what Old Forester puts out next If you enjoyed this style of review find similar reviews at www

Tried my first review,I ve had plenty of discussions with all kinds of whiskey drinkers from enthusiasts though brewers distillers not sure which is the proper English name Never tried a self written review though until now Got a whiskey I had never heard of so figured it might be nice to describe my experience without any sort of predesposition I tried to balance typical descriptions with accessible language so that it doesn t sound too pretentious which I hate The whiskey is Douglas Laing s Provenance distilled by Benrinnes in May bottle in November I think that uniquely defines the bottle if not please let me know I d love to hear feedback both on the specific whiskey and my general writing style It s my first try so please be anything but kind Here it is A great balance between smooth and complex In this price class the oddly translucent Benrinnes delivers a surprising depth of flavor breaking the usual color correlations of mid to mid high range whiskeys Prominent dark aromas like cocao and espresso almost mask the slight smokiness and a hint of tutti frutti The short swallow reveals a mild fig like sweetness teasing the tutti frutti once again A longer pull justifies the years noted on the bottle with the expectations brought forth by the aroma made whole The slight bourbon esque fuses with a fruitiness of the berry family Thicker sweet fruits like the fig from the first impression make a reappearance albeit in a second rank The whole experience surprises from a boring looking bottle with a cheap bright color to a friendly multidimensional travel through the more typical of flavors A great bottle for the junior whiskey fanatic who wishes to expand his territory without having to break his spirit with ashtrays and caskstrength ,1,Tried my first review I ve had plenty of discussions with all kinds of whiskey drinkers from enthusiasts though brewers distillers not sure which is the proper English name Never tried a self written review though until now Got a whiskey I had never heard of so figured it might be nice to describe my experience without any sort of predesposition I tried to balance typical descriptions with accessible language so that it doesn t sound too pretentious which I hate The whiskey is Douglas Laing s Provenance distilled by Benrinnes in May bottle in November I think that uniquely defines the bottle if not please let me know I d love to hear feedback both on the specific whiskey and my general writing style It s my first try so please be anything but kind Here it is A great balance between smooth and complex In this price class the oddly translucent Benrinnes delivers a surprising depth of flavor breaking the usual color correlations of mid to mid high range whiskeys Prominent dark aromas like cocao and espresso almost mask the slight smokiness and a hint of tutti frutti The short swallow reveals a mild fig like sweetness teasing the tutti frutti once again A longer pull justifies the years noted on the bottle with the expectations brought forth by the aroma made whole The slight bourbon esque fuses with a fruitiness of the berry family Thicker sweet fruits like the fig from the first impression make a reappearance albeit in a second rank The whole experience surprises from a boring looking bottle with a cheap bright color to a friendly multidimensional travel through the more typical of flavors A great bottle for the junior whiskey fanatic who wishes to expand his territory without having to break his spirit with ashtrays and caskstrength

An amateur drinks Pikesville Rye,I ve been drinking whisk e y all my life mainly scotch single malts and a few blends more recently bourbon And I ve picked up the idea that rye is in many ways America s more signature whiskey if a single whiskey style was to define America it would be rye So to test this notion I bought a bottle of Pikesville not cheap here in Australia Most reviews or descriptions of rye seem to talk about it being spicy and hot and these were certainly the first effects as I carefully nosed a splash in my glass I was going to drink it neat A peppery cinnamon y mown grass y sort of smell a rich wildness a smell almost of untamed ness This is not a parlour whiskey Next to the mouth and the promise of spicy heat didn t disappoint although even at proof it s not hard to drink in small sips in my case I must say I found the first few mouthfuls a bit difficult I was getting a spiciness to be sure but I wasn t really enjoying it I couldn t get a sense of flavour through the spice It was sort of like a spicy covering over a rather flavourless middle But I think this was me wrestling with a very unfamiliar style By the end of the glass I was getting a fuller and richer taste and the famed cherry cola taste could be noted I actually don t like cherry cola and maybe it was the hint of this that first put me off But in the context of this whiskey I began to enjoy it more and by sips seven or eight I was beginning to get a better sense of the taste although still dominated by the spice I have no idea where Pikesville stands in the rye world I know it s picked up numerous awards and I ve seen it recommended in lots of places Whether it s a good starting rye I don t know But to me who usually drinks without being too fussy about it it s a change from the rounder sweeter bourbons and of course to Scottish malts I suspect it will take me a little time and a few more glasses to really enjoy it which I m sure I will and it s a journey I m looking forward to Bottoms up folks ,1,An amateur drinks Pikesville Rye I ve been drinking whisk e y all my life mainly scotch single malts and a few blends more recently bourbon And I ve picked up the idea that rye is in many ways America s more signature whiskey if a single whiskey style was to define America it would be rye So to test this notion I bought a bottle of Pikesville not cheap here in Australia Most reviews or descriptions of rye seem to talk about it being spicy and hot and these were certainly the first effects as I carefully nosed a splash in my glass I was going to drink it neat A peppery cinnamon y mown grass y sort of smell a rich wildness a smell almost of untamed ness This is not a parlour whiskey Next to the mouth and the promise of spicy heat didn t disappoint although even at proof it s not hard to drink in small sips in my case I must say I found the first few mouthfuls a bit difficult I was getting a spiciness to be sure but I wasn t really enjoying it I couldn t get a sense of flavour through the spice It was sort of like a spicy covering over a rather flavourless middle But I think this was me wrestling with a very unfamiliar style By the end of the glass I was getting a fuller and richer taste and the famed cherry cola taste could be noted I actually don t like cherry cola and maybe it was the hint of this that first put me off But in the context of this whiskey I began to enjoy it more and by sips seven or eight I was beginning to get a better sense of the taste although still dominated by the spice I have no idea where Pikesville stands in the rye world I know it s picked up numerous awards and I ve seen it recommended in lots of places Whether it s a good starting rye I don t know But to me who usually drinks without being too fussy about it it s a change from the rounder sweeter bourbons and of course to Scottish malts I suspect it will take me a little time and a few more glasses to really enjoy it which I m sure I will and it s a journey I m looking forward to Bottoms up folks

I know you probably get spammed every year but I d appreciate your help picking out a Christmas gift for my Grandpa , ish range but flexible Tldr Johnny Walker Blue but cheaper Story time for those wondering why I m being a cheap ass with my wonderful grandpa Last year I went on a trip with my boyfriend to visit his family out of state My grandpa watched my dogs for me It would have cost or more to kennel them but more importantly they are old spoiled dogs and I didn t want them to be scared or confused since they ve never been kenneled before My saint of a grandpa came over twice a day to feed them let them outside and play with them a bit I was trying to think of a good thank you gift Like most ex military dudes he likes a good drink I can t remember his usual but it s about for a handle and he adds a bit of water or ice to make it smoother My grandma rations him to two fingers a day she keeps track of every cent of their money so he can t buy more than she allows him to buy but family frequently gifts him secret booze and he hides it in his garage and drinks it when she s not paying attention Once a year we ll get a frantic call because she thinks he s having a stroke but he s just drunk and slurring and she can t understand him Yeah that s a lot to unpack but he s His doctors are amazed at how healthy he is and if it gives him joy to drink especially the challenge of doing it behind grandma s back then that s the perfect gift I bought him a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue because I heard it was smooth and it was in a price range appropriate for his generosity Well sort of I think he deserves MORE but I knew if he knew how much it cost he d have a fit I knew he d probably think it was dumb to spend that much money on something but he s old He should be enjoying the finer things in life and he wouldn t be so bold as to Google the price He went home and googled the price He called me imediately and chewed me out for spending so much on him I told him kenneling would cost more he still saved me money and my doggos were much better off just chilling at home I still got the better end of the deal just drink the booze or regift it He said Well next time just get me worth of the cheap stuff then Shit can t be worth for fucks sake I said How the hell will you hide four handles of booze from Grandma He said I have my ways I said Nah I m not going to be responsible for that much contraband Get your own cheap stuff old man just use this for special occasions to enjoy and savor He grumbled and complained a little more about how stupid and it was and hung up the phone About a month later I m woken up to the sound of banging in my kitchen I have a fenced in yard but I don t lock my backdoor I get up to investigate and I see my damn Grandpa in the kitchen You need to do your dishes kid where s a clean cup You gotta try this shit It was am by the way Apparently my cousin was in town and him and my grandpa cracked open the bottle the night before They saved a little for me to try This is so smooth I didn t even have to water it down just enjoyed the taste I took a sip but it just tasted like booze I can t handle I pretended Oh yeah it s good so smooth Thanks for letting me try it Glad you liked it Crazy old man liked it so much his drunk ass made sure to save me some hopped my fence and broke into my kitchen to have me try it at am the next day I love that dude I don t know what smooth means in relation to whisky I m made of weakness and it all tastes like I m being hit in the face with a campfire So if one of you more refined

The Whiskey Shelf Review Maker s Mark Cask Strength Batch , This and other reviews can be found at my whiskey blog called The Whiskey Shelf Distillery Maker s Mark Region Kentucky USA Type Bourbon wheated Alcohol Composition corn soft winter wheat malted barley Aged NAS rumored years aged in virgin American white oak Price on sale mL but likely normally Overview Maker s Mark is a legendary global whiskey brand and one of the first to create a premium image decades ago for its bourbon Unlike many other brands Maker s Mark only has products with some variations added to it original Maker s Mark and Maker s I was lucky enough to visit the distillery and go on their tour a few years ago and remember buying my first bottle of the cask strength variety as part of the tour I really enjoyed it and even got to dip my own bottle in wax While this product was initially only sold at the distillery distribution expanded more recently to the entire US A little more commentary on wheated bourbon rye is the more common grain used as a secondary grain in bourbon but there are a handful that replace rye with wheat creating different tastes and smells Wheat is supposed to help create a smoother and sweeter bourbon whereas rye adds spice and mint Think about the difference between wheat bread and rye bread and you can imagine how the two might taste different in bourbon There aren t that many wheated bourbons on the market but that number is growing Smell Maker s Mark did not exaggerate when they said smooth The first sniff is incredibly smooth and mellow with only a hint of the alcohol hidden inside that you would expect to flatten you Even as I sniff harder to try to overwhelm my nose it still doesn t happen The smells are also incredibly amped up as Maker s Mark says There s a combination of honey brown sugar maple syrup caramel and vanilla that screams pecan pie The scent is especially prominent when I m nearly done and all I can smell is the liquid that coats the glass Additional sniffs also reveal some wood oak and cinnamon as is expected from bourbon The sweet notes are strong but stand out enough to balance the alcohol and wood On top of the sweetness there are strong floral herbal grassy and earthy notes like standing in the middle of a field as well as a touch of sourdough bread and yeast This combination of sweet and floral also reminds me of sweet tea with only a dash of sugar All in all Maker s Mark Cask Strength smells like you re walking through a field in the middle of summer with a pecan pie in your hand going to your friend s house for dinner It s a lovely smell Taste Aftertaste No surprise but this tastes like it smells Every sip is intense yet smooth and complex The alcohol is noticeable but never overpowering for me but nevertheless may overwhelm others On my first sip I immediately notice a moderate sweetness of brown sugar The longer I leave it in my mouth the more I taste the cinnamon and wood spice as the alcohol coats my mouth and begins to burn On subsequent sips where I intentionally leave the liquid in my mouth for seconds Maker s Mark Cask Strength develops citrus cherry herbal and sour cornmeal flavors but only a little The taste of sour cornmeal like bourbon mash right before distillation also appears It s a little sweet and savory from the corn but also sour from fermentation For me the sour note is unique to Maker s Mark If you ever get a chance to try the mash while on a tour definitely go for it Just make sure you ask for permission first from your guide The aftertaste is grassy and floral After I swallow there immediately is a gentle dryness and bitterness reminiscent of black tea There s also something there akin to salted peanuts The aftertaste is not as sweet as expected given its smell and taste but that s not a bad thing This leaves my mouth pretty dry especially when I leave it in my mouth for seconds Overall Score Top Shelf Maker s Mark Cask Strength is an incredibly rich and delicious bourbon It s a multifaceted drink that demands that you sit down and savor it The wheat provides exceptional flavor and smoothness making the bourbon less punchy than you would expect Nevertheless it is still very potent and thick With only a few wheated bourbons in the market and many of them extremely difficult to find e g Weller Pappy Parker s Heritage and most mass market competition coming from Larceny and Rebel Yell Maker s Mark Cask Strength is an excellent buy even at the price point When I previously did a tasting of cask strength bourbons Full Proof Bulleit Barrel Strength and Maker s Mark Cask Strength I found Maker s Mark to be by and far better than the other two I highly recommend it and have actually purchased of these smaller bottles because it s just that good Something I like a little better Stagg Jr Batch Something I like a little less Van Winkle Special Reserve Rating System The Glass Case A truly exceptional whiskey with flawless smell and taste that should be treasured savored and shared with your closest friends It makes me say wow this is one of the the best drinks I ve ever had Very few whiskeys will ever receive this rating Top Shelf A great whiskey worth buying with standout smells and flavors but with some small flaws It makes me say wow this is amazing Many of my favorite whiskeys fall into this category Mid Shelf A solid whiskey with good qualities but lacks standout traits that makes it interesting It also has significant flaws that detract from the overall experience It makes me say this is pretty good Bottom Shelf

Whiskey Storage and How Long it Lasts,I know this has probably been posted before but I wanted to hear some anecdotal answers on the topic From my research it is generally believed that if a whiskey is unopened and stored correctly dark place away from the sun room temp no cork leakage it will last forever An opened bottle with of more will last up to years half empty bottle will last years and or less will need to be finished in a few months The claim is that the more air in a bottle the faster the whiskey will oxidize thus changing the taste I recently heard from Horst Leuning on his youtube channel that very old ages of whiskey are not affected by oxidization since they have already been fully oxidized in the barrel What is everyone s experiences on the matter ,1,Whiskey Storage and How Long it Lasts I know this has probably been posted before but I wanted to hear some anecdotal answers on the topic From my research it is generally believed that if a whiskey is unopened and stored correctly dark place away from the sun room temp no cork leakage it will last forever An opened bottle with of more will last up to years half empty bottle will last years and or less will need to be finished in a few months The claim is that the more air in a bottle the faster the whiskey will oxidize thus changing the taste I recently heard from Horst Leuning on his youtube channel that very old ages of whiskey are not affected by oxidization since they have already been fully oxidized in the barrel What is everyone s experiences on the matter

All Part of the Whisky Journey, SD Blog All part of the Journey POSTED AUGUST SCOTCH DUMMIES Greasing the wheels This week we reviewed a bribe bottle Not a huge bribe but the kind no one really had a problem with in the first place I felt I had to buy a bottle of Tamdhu to complement a bottle we were gifted and the best place to search out anything that may be challenging to locate is of course on the internet I quickly located my bottle at www caskers com and added it to the cart This is where the bribe comes in It is only a couple of dollars more to ship bottles instead of one and so I went to browse the selection That was where I discovered this beautiful bottle that we had heard some great things about and added it to the collection so no one would ask too many questions The journey is the best part While getting ready to shoot this review I went back to my notes about Deanston history I love the fact that this distillery is young in terms of scotch distilleries and was actually a cotton mill since the late s The history of the community centered around the success and expansion of this business for almost years until the mill closed This is the best part of the story for me because rather than allow the community to decline it decided to reinvent itself They began a distillery in the s and I am so happy this was the way they chose to revive industry in the village The whisky they produce here is flavorful complex and thoroughly enjoyable while remaining affordable The flavor of this scotch would be enough to keep me coming back but I love the story of this distillery Deanston feels like the underdog in this story since the shutting down of the only industry in a community has been the downfall of countless towns and villages before That could have been the story here as well but it turned out they beat the odds and now we all have the chance to enjoy a great dram from an underdog Scotch Dummies really started as a reason to get together and discover new whisky On our journey we have been introduced by chance or by more knowledgeable peers to several distilleries that I can t say enough about They are the reason I will throw down to buy a bottle from a distillery I know nothing about on the chance it is amazing Deanston is one of those distilleries I had never heard of the distillery before we started reviewing scotch but now that I have tried a few bottles I will never forget it The story plus the amazing scotch will keep me coming to the bar every Thursday for a long time If you don t believe me buy a bottle and have a dram while

Cheap whiskey isn t bad whiskey If you find a niche that you enjoy it isn t bad to build your collection around that,So I ve lurked on a lot of these whisk e y subs for a while and I ve noticed that beginners often come to these subs in search of where they should start or continue to build a collection of whiskey that not only they will like but friends can enjoy too However if you find a region of whisk e y that you enjoy don t be ashamed to enjoy that and to explore other whisk e y like it and when you try a new type of whisk e y or are trying to Branch out into other regions try multiple good but less expensive bottles rather then going for expensive high end whisk e y from that region you can often get a better feel for your take on that type of whisk e y Oftentimes the more expensive bottles are the characteristics of a particular region emboldened making it harder to ease your way in and get a real feel for that region So just do you folks if you find your niche and you really like something don t be afraid to enjoy that niche and when and if you branch out don t feel like you have to try the most expensive whisk e y a region has to offer to get a real honest refection of what that region has to offer Except Canada it s all crown in cool bottles I kid I kid tl dr enjoy what you enjoy if you expand you horizons you don t have to do so with bottles ,1,Cheap whiskey isn t bad whiskey If you find a niche that you enjoy it isn t bad to build your collection around that So I ve lurked on a lot of these whisk e y subs for a while and I ve noticed that beginners often come to these subs in search of where they should start or continue to build a collection of whiskey that not only they will like but friends can enjoy too However if you find a region of whisk e y that you enjoy don t be ashamed to enjoy that and to explore other whisk e y like it and when you try a new type of whisk e y or are trying to Branch out into other regions try multiple good but less expensive bottles rather then going for expensive high end whisk e y from that region you can often get a better feel for your take on that type of whisk e y Oftentimes the more expensive bottles are the characteristics of a particular region emboldened making it harder to ease your way in and get a real feel for that region So just do you folks if you find your niche and you really like something don t be afraid to enjoy that niche and when and if you branch out don t feel like you have to try the most expensive whisk e y a region has to offer to get a real honest refection of what that region has to offer Except Canada it s all crown in cool bottles I kid I kid tl dr enjoy what you enjoy if you expand you horizons you don t have to do so with bottles

Question on taste,I ve had an experience with a couple whiskies that I m having trouble finding info on and I m hoping someone can point me towards a reason Sorry in advance for the low wall of text A few years ago I bought a bottle of Balvenie pretty certain it was a year old and wasn t finished in sherry or other flavor casks When I opened it it just smelled off Fermentation is probably the best description for it just a rotten off putting smell I tried a dram and got a very strong sour rotten flavor from it and after a couple attempts with subsequent pours with water and letting it air for over an hour I just dumped the bottle because it was undrinkable Assuming it was a fluke a bad bottle I moved on but haven t bought any Balvenie since A couple weeks ago I picked up a small bottle of Classic Laddie while at Bruichladdich I love their Port Charlotte line but hadn t had the classic before When I opened it I got what smelled like that same rotten or fermentation smell The flavor was pretty similar as well Just bad I powered through a first pour and a couple days later tried letting another one air tried water nothing worked Again figured something was off and moved on What triggered this was smelling Balvenie again the other day and getting that same scent Smelling it again after years makes me think my bad bottle wasn t actually bad and that I m sensitive to a chemical or something that others don t notice Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this or am I just rambling I d love to find an explanation so I can both avoid it in future and maybe help someone else out down the road when it happens to them ,1,Question on taste I ve had an experience with a couple whiskies that I m having trouble finding info on and I m hoping someone can point me towards a reason Sorry in advance for the low wall of text A few years ago I bought a bottle of Balvenie pretty certain it was a year old and wasn t finished in sherry or other flavor casks When I opened it it just smelled off Fermentation is probably the best description for it just a rotten off putting smell I tried a dram and got a very strong sour rotten flavor from it and after a couple attempts with subsequent pours with water and letting it air for over an hour I just dumped the bottle because it was undrinkable Assuming it was a fluke a bad bottle I moved on but haven t bought any Balvenie since A couple weeks ago I picked up a small bottle of Classic Laddie while at Bruichladdich I love their Port Charlotte line but hadn t had the classic before When I opened it I got what smelled like that same rotten or fermentation smell The flavor was pretty similar as well Just bad I powered through a first pour and a couple days later tried letting another one air tried water nothing worked Again figured something was off and moved on What triggered this was smelling Balvenie again the other day and getting that same scent Smelling it again after years makes me think my bad bottle wasn t actually bad and that I m sensitive to a chemical or something that others don t notice Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this or am I just rambling I d love to find an explanation so I can both avoid it in future and maybe help someone else out down the road when it happens to them

Hakushu Live Review,After quite a bit of looking I was at a big box store HyVee and saw a row of Hakushu to my surprise and for a shockingly low I had to pick it up since all of our liquor stores were out with no idea when they would get getting more So I m popping this bad boy open and sharing what I taste as I go along If you have any questions feel free to ask Drank Neat in a Glencairn glass allowed to rest for minutes Color Very pale yellow extremely similar to Toki Nose Smells exactly like Glenfiddich mixed with Toki to me very bright floral notes citrus peel honey green apple and if you really dig your nose into the glass you ll get the faintest hint of peat Overall this is a really really pretty nose Again imagine Glenfiddich and Toki mixed but much more refined To be honest when I first smelled this after opening it I was really really disappointed I was so afraid that I had just paid bucks for Glenfiddich and it s not that the nose is bad it s really nice actually it s just not anything unique certainly not an nose Palette Initially this whisky is extremely bright and sweet from the subtle peat on the nose and the abv I wasn t expecting it to be so sweet up front it s incredibly floral beautiful and smooth with almost no burn whatsoever as it reaches the back of your mouth the complexity of this whisky really shines you get these really deep grassy and pine notes which I thought would be odd but it is absolutely beautiful and refreshing one of the nicest flavor profiles I ve had in a whisk e y According to the tasters notes on Suntory s website they say Mint and Kiwi on the palette which upon looking for those notes you absolutely do get both of them right at the end as the grassy notes die down but not before the finish They also say pear but I m not sure I get that on this whisky I do on the nose not so much the palette The kiwi for those who may have a hard time finding it is really more like the bitter notes of kiwi seeds rather than the meat of the kiwi it s much more subtle in my opinion Finish Rich slightly peaty mint and kiwi persist from palette to finish on this one with pine needle intermingling pretty intensely there s also some subtle peppery notes at the very end of the finish The finish on this one for me is extremely long the richness of the oils on this whisky coat your tongue and don t leave for quite some time I m seconds into this finish and only just noticing the flavors going away Overall This is a whisky that comes from the forest and I don t think you could come to any other conclusion upon drinking it It s beautifully complex nuanced subtle truly a beautiful beautiful whisky and it really does capture the environment of the distillery it was made at To be clear I m not some Japanese whisky fanboy I think Toki is average at best and it sort of makes me sick from the sweetness and spiciness of it I think you can get better scotches for less than Nikka etc but this whisky I truly believe has some interesting and worthwhile complexity to it to justify the price tag Would I pay the ridiculous I ve seen online for it No chance would I pay the I paid for it You bet for that price I think this is an absolutely wonderful whisky I do think the nose on this one is a little boring due to the fact I ve had plenty of single malt scotch with nearly identical noses for half the price but the palette and the finish are where this whisky really shines Should you go buy it That s up to you there s plenty of good whisk e y you can get at this price point that isn t this whisky but if you like Japanese whisky I can absolutely promise you this one isn t going to disappoint My rating worth the money for me ,1,Hakushu Live Review After quite a bit of looking I was at a big box store HyVee and

Tasting notes for auld stag Egyptian whiskey,The thing to know about this whiskey is that each bottle batch is slightly different The taste and character even changes depending on how much time passed on production and how much time the bottle spent open It has nothing special but when it is new it is very strong and even jumps to your eyes It has some oak and sometimes smokiness and a faint hint of caramel I don t have a lot of experience with whiskey but it becomes smoother with time time since production and since the bottle has been opened then the caramel becomes easier to notice Given the price it is the best and for me the only thing affordable It costs EGPs which is around other better imported brands here cost way more than due to taxation It is hard to make whiskey in a mostly Muslim country were you may be killed for selling alcohol Let s say I love whiskey too much to risk being spotted buying it even if it is the only affordable Egyptian brand that doesn t taste all that good I hope you all get a chance to try it It is always an adventure because you don t know what you are gonna get Still it has become much much better compared to the reviews I read online ,1,Tasting notes for auld stag Egyptian whiskey The thing to know about this whiskey is that each bottle batch is slightly different The taste and character even changes depending on how much time passed on production and how much time the bottle spent open It has nothing special but when it is new it is very strong and even jumps to your eyes It has some oak and sometimes smokiness and a faint hint of caramel I don t have a lot of experience with whiskey but it becomes smoother with time time since production and since the bottle has been opened then the caramel becomes easier to notice Given the price it is the best and for me the only thing affordable It costs EGPs which is around other better imported brands here cost way more than due to taxation It is hard to make whiskey in a mostly Muslim country were you may be killed for selling alcohol Let s say I love whiskey too much to risk being spotted buying it even if it is the only affordable Egyptian brand that doesn t taste all that good I hope you all get a chance to try it It is always an adventure because you don t know what you are gonna get Still it has become much much better compared to the reviews I read online

Does Anyone Use Whiskey Stones Soapstone ,My understanding is that some people use small stone cubes instead of ice to cool their whisk e y to prevent diluting it or altering the taste I also read enough to know that they tend to use soapstone Would an expert be able to weigh in on whether cubes or spheres would be better or if they need to be imperfection free to ensure bacteria can t accumulate Any advice appreciated I plan to purchase this ,1,Does Anyone Use Whiskey Stones Soapstone  My understanding is that some people use small stone cubes instead of ice to cool their whisk e y to prevent diluting it or altering the taste I also read enough to know that they tend to use soapstone Would an expert be able to weigh in on whether cubes or spheres would be better or if they need to be imperfection free to ensure bacteria can t accumulate Any advice appreciated I plan to purchase this

Story Time Excited To Share The World Of Whisky With My Friend I Find An Old Dusty Bottle,Was drinking with a friend who I had recently gifted a bottle of Monkey Shoulder to his first Scotch and when we finished the bottle I got the wild idea that I needed to go get another bottle of Scotch right then I found the only sober person at the party and asked them to drive me to the nearest liquor store I wanted to get something smokey and interesting since we were just discussing how varied and interesting Scotch can be we just finished drinking a nice sweet friendly Speyside blend so now I wanted a mean in your face smokey Islay The first liquor store we went to had tweakers inside and nothing but boring blended Scotch Weak sauce So I convinced my driver to try another place down the road this wasn t my neighborhood and I was just searching Google Maps and hoping for the best The next liquor store was more promising First of all there weren t any tweakers inside or outside and they had some single malts but they were all Highlands and Speysides I asked the clerk if they had any Islay Single Malts and he looked at me like I was speaking another language I said You know like really smokey Lagavulin is a popular one Still all I got was a blank stare like I was some sort of alien As I m standing there debating whether I should just get one of the bottles he had or risk asking my friend to go on an even longer ridiculous trip to find Scotch the clerk says to me Oh actually I think we have some other Scotch over here He leads me into a dark corner in the back of his store and lo and behold he did have a few other single malts sitting on a dusty shelf but still no Islay Goddammit And then I saw it hiding on a lower shelf all covered in dust and in a box I didn t recognize Highland Park I thought to myself Well Jay my driver isn t going to want to go to another store Highland Park not an Islay but its an Island and kinda smokey This is the best you re going to get I grabbed the box and headed to the counter I asked the clerk I don t recognize this label How long has this been on your shelf He just shrugged his shoulders I opened the box to make sure it contained the HP and it hadn t all evaporated I handed it over to the clerk and he then busts out this hand duster and proceeds to dust off the box and bottle I had never seen that in my life though I did appreciate the service I finished the purchase and got into the car and told my friend what I just went through When I got back to the party I didn t tell anyone that the bottle was old and dusty thinking it may influence their thoughts on it once we tasted it And then it happened As I was opening up the bottle removing the seal and removing the cork the cork breaks Ah hell I say Well this bottle was probably sitting on that guys shelf for years and then proceeded to tell my friend the story of the multiple liquor stores and the clerk with the duster I managed to get the broken half that was stuck in the bottle out and poured a couple of glasses As far as I could tell the whisky was perfectly fine My friend wasn t over the moon about the Scotch and the whole thing was more effort than it was worth but I guess I got a story out of it right So yea cool story bro but there is another reason I posted this here Two questions Does anyone know what years Highland Park used this label And Is there any chance the whisky was less than optimal considering the condition of the cork I mean this thing absolutely disintegrated I was kinda drunk so I didn t trust my taste buds at the time I mean there was nothing rotten or sour about it and it was good enough that I had several drams of it but I still wonder if it may have lost a little of its punch somehow Ok thanks for reading if you got this far and

Has anyone else noticed this whiskey marketing ploy ,While on a distillery tour in Scotland the tour guide was trying to convince the group that the market for aged whiskey was an element of snobbery that her company was trying to dissuade She made the point of asking rhetorically who amongst us could tell the age of a whiskey in a blind taste test or which of us would be able to distinguish the older of two whiskeys in a blind taste test While she was undoubtedly correct for the majority of casual whiskey drinkers myself included I felt that her motive was more along the lines of marketing younger whiskey to increase turnover of the product She made the point of mentioning that they lose approximately of whiskey by volume per year that it sits in the barrels This means that the older a whiskey is the more has gone to the angels share and the more time they have had to pay for storage They produce a lot of whiskey and by convincing the market that young is just as good as old they can sell a lot more a lot sooner paying less in storage cost along the way Has anyone else come across this ploy What are your thoughts ,1,Has anyone else noticed this whiskey marketing ploy  While on a distillery tour in Scotland the tour guide was trying to convince the group that the market for aged whiskey was an element of snobbery that her company was trying to dissuade She made the point of asking rhetorically who amongst us could tell the age of a whiskey in a blind taste test or which of us would be able to distinguish the older of two whiskeys in a blind taste test While she was undoubtedly correct for the majority of casual whiskey drinkers myself included I felt that her motive was more along the lines of marketing younger whiskey to increase turnover of the product She made the point of mentioning that they lose approximately of whiskey by volume per year that it sits in the barrels This means that the older a whiskey is the more has gone to the angels share and the more time they have had to pay for storage They produce a lot of whiskey and by convincing the market that young is just as good as old they can sell a lot more a lot sooner paying less in storage cost along the way Has anyone else come across this ploy What are your thoughts

Would Anyone be interested in an at home whiskey tasting class ,Hey all new to the community here I am a bartender in Nashville I am beginning stages of designing a company that would do spirit tasting classes lead by bartenders that really know their stuff and have spent time in distilleries and learning from the people that make these products We would most likely start with whiskey bourbon and then branch into other spirits as interest grows Initially classes would be lead in home AKA we come to you and throw a whiskey party at your house or you go to a friends house and attend a party My current idea would be to taste products at a oz pour for each because I ve been to tastings where you just get a little finger of everything and nobody s got time for that Your bartender teacher would not only walk you through each of the products but the history of the spirit itself tips for what to look for when tasting and how to taste properly and some of the history and distinctions of each product we taste through In my research I haven t been able to find any companies that provide this kind of experience in a small intimate setting where you re really just chatting with someone who s worked behind a bar and has a lot of expertise I joined the community to begin gauging interest in this type of service as I believe there is a national market that could be expanded into if our model is successful So if there were a service like that where you could buy a ticket to go to a whiskey or other spirit tasting at a friends place get to drink a lot of really great whiskey and learn a ton in the process as well as come away with recommendations for how to shop look for products on your own is that something anyone would be interested in And if so how much would you pay for an individual ticket to something like that Any help feedback I can get at this stage in the startup would be super great Thanks y all ,1,Would Anyone be interested in an at home whiskey tasting class  Hey all new to the community here I am a bartender in Nashville I am beginning stages of designing a company that would do spirit tasting classes lead by bartenders that really know their stuff and have spent time in distilleries and learning from the people that make these products We would most likely start with whiskey bourbon and then branch into other spirits as interest grows Initially classes would be lead in home AKA we come to you and throw a whiskey party at your house or you go to a friends house and attend a party My current idea would be to taste products at a oz pour for each because I ve been to tastings where you just get a little finger of everything and nobody s got time for that Your bartender teacher would not only walk you through each of the products but the history of the spirit itself tips for what to look for when tasting and how to taste properly and some of the history and distinctions of each product we taste through In my research I haven t been able to find any companies that provide this kind of experience in a small intimate setting where you re really just chatting with someone who s worked behind a bar and has a lot of expertise I joined the community to begin gauging interest in this type of service as I believe there is a national market that could be expanded into if our model is successful So if there were a service like that where you could buy a ticket to go to a whiskey or other spirit tasting at a friends place get to drink a lot of really great whiskey and learn a ton in the process as well as come away with recommendations for how to shop look for products on your own is that something anyone would be interested in And if so how much would you pay for an individual ticket to something like that Any help feedback I can get at this stage in the startup would be super great Thanks y all

Basil Hayden Dark Rye, Seems to be a blend of American rye Canadian rye and port I haven t looked into this much so I ve no idea how long the ryes were in barrel I have no idea what port was used I m sure it was not vintage But I picked this up the other day on a whim I opened it to it and the typical spicy nose from the bottle relative to other ryes was definitely lacking in my opinion Poured a dram and dropped in one small cube as is typical for me This is a lot sweeter due to the port In fact I think the port takes away a lot from what could be a decent blended product That s not to say this is a bad pour In fact the sweetness makes it somewhat ideal for an after dinner drink But I do miss the spiciness that great bite you get from a great rye This will last me a while I hope others enjoy it ,1,Basil Hayden Dark Rye  Seems to be a blend of American rye Canadian rye and port I haven t looked into this much so I ve no idea how long the ryes were in barrel I have no idea what port was used I m sure it was not vintage But I picked this up the other day on a whim I opened it to it and the typical spicy nose from the bottle relative to other ryes was definitely lacking in my opinion Poured a dram and dropped in one small cube as is typical for me This is a lot sweeter due to the port In fact I think the port takes away a lot from what could be a decent blended product That s not to say this is a bad pour In fact the sweetness makes it somewhat ideal for an after dinner drink But I do miss the spiciness that great bite you get from a great rye This will last me a while I hope others enjoy it

looking for some irish whiskey recommendations,I m far from a connoisseur but I normally drink bourbon and I m looking to try some Irish whiskey As for bourbon I ve tried Maker s Mark Maker s Gentleman Jack Elijah Craig Small Batch Four Roses Small Batch Bulleit Knob Creek Wild Turkey and Paddleford Creek Small Batch I d say my favorites are Maker s Mark and Bulleit The other day I picked up a bottle of Jameson Black Barrel which I thought was decent but I still much prefer Maker s or Bulleit I usually buy in the range and was hoping to get some recommendations for Irish whiskeys I might like I saw Teeling Small Batch on the whiskey guide here which is in my price range but other than that I didn t see anything or under Is it safe to say getting decent Irish Whiskey is going to be quite a bit more expensive then a decent Bourbon in the US ,1,looking for some irish whiskey recommendations I m far from a connoisseur but I normally drink bourbon and I m looking to try some Irish whiskey As for bourbon I ve tried Maker s Mark Maker s Gentleman Jack Elijah Craig Small Batch Four Roses Small Batch Bulleit Knob Creek Wild Turkey and Paddleford Creek Small Batch I d say my favorites are Maker s Mark and Bulleit The other day I picked up a bottle of Jameson Black Barrel which I thought was decent but I still much prefer Maker s or Bulleit I usually buy in the range and was hoping to get some recommendations for Irish whiskeys I might like I saw Teeling Small Batch on the whiskey guide here which is in my price range but other than that I didn t see anything or under Is it safe to say getting decent Irish Whiskey is going to be quite a bit more expensive then a decent Bourbon in the US

Distillery Roadtrip Review,This is a copy of a blog post that I wrote Click the link at the bottom to go to the post itself which has pictures and links to more detail on each distillery I don t make money off of the review or the blog in general When I started planning my distillery drive I didn t find many lists that reviewed the distilleries as in depth as I would have liked So I pieced together what I could find and decided that when I was done I would write the review that I wished I had This review will cover the ten distilleries five on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail that I visited over three days Though I wasn t able to hit them all I hope this can be helpful for anyone else thinking about a similar trip I ll include three sections The first is an overview of the drive and some reflections on the trip overall After that will be my own profile of each distillery Finally I ll include a few lists of top distilleries by category Also probably obvious but I m receiving no compensation from anyone for writing this up The Drive Overall First it s important to point out that all of our visits were done on weekdays and many were early in the day Most tour guides told us that crowds could get much larger on weekends so if you re trying to hit a lot of stops go on weekdays if possible A regret along with not buying the Maker s Mark was not visiting Willett It s my favorite Rye and yet somehow I forgot to plan it into our itinerary Worst of all was that we drove right past it while we were in Bardstown visiting Barton s and Heaven Hill Guess I ll just have to go back and visit again I was disappointed that the distilleries didn t give us more information to take with us from the tasting Jack Daniels was the only one that had a paper with notes that I could take away I understand that places need to get you through quick but more interactive tools would have helped me remember what I liked about each whiskey that I tried Some fun trends Every tour in Kentucky told us about how they allow pictures everywhere on their tour with either a direct or an indirect statement that others don t Yet only Jack Daniel s and George Dickel didn t allow pictures at some points Also every tour guide had two names Now for the distilleries I won t get too into the qualities of the whiskeys themselves as it would take up a lot of space I m not a great taster and my purpose was to try them not rate them Barton s Barton Rd Bardstown KY Highlight The tour My favorite tour of the whole trip Lowlight The guard loudly purposefully waking my wife up when we pulled into the gate Tour Bushel to Bottle My favorite tour we went on Being the only people on the tour may have given us more access interaction than if we were in a big group A lot of walking and stairs Tasting One of my least favorites but it was free I forgot to write down which whiskeys we tasted but I wasn t a big fan The coffee and cream liquor was great though Value Free no complaints there Ambiance Nothing beautiful but I enjoyed walking around the area and smelling the grains in the air Freebies You get to take home a bung stamped with the date of your tour Visitor Center Gift Shop Standard They had t shirts whiskey candles cups coasters Definitely Go If You want value and are most interested in how whiskey is made Definitely Avoid If The tasting and or seeing beautiful things is really important to you Heaven Hill Bourbon Heritage Center Gilkey Run Road Bardstown KY Highlight Focused tasting experience Lowlight None Tour No tour just tasting Tasting Connoisseur Experience Pricey but you get what you pay for I tasted five whiskeys one of which was years old and meant to show the group how age doesn t always equal quality Otherwise I got what I wanted out of this stop tasting quality whiskeys Value A little on the pricey side They were good whiskeys but was steep for no tour Ambiance One of the best The set up in the tasting room was classy The building and grounds are welcoming Visitor Center Gift Shop Extensive gift shop with a nice educational area to read through at your own pace Freebies Cardboard coaster and the glass from the tasting Definitely Go If You really just want a tour with a side of mini museum Definitely Avoid If You only want a tour of a distillery Maker s Mark Burks Spring Rd Loretto KY Highlight Beautiful Grounds Lowlight None Tour hours total The grounds are beautiful so that s a plus You don t get to see as much of the actual process as at the other distilleries You ll hear about it throughout the walk though A lot of walking but few steps Tasting We got to taste five of their whiskeys Unaged Maker s Mark Barrel Proof and the Private Select Tasting Panel Value For I would say this was one of the best values Decent tour and great tasting Ambiance I almost forgot I was at a distillery Seemed more like a wedding venue Visitor Center Gift Shop Standard gift shop at the end of the tour You can dip your own bottle if you buy one there Freebies A Maker s Mark label Definitely Go If You want to see something beautiful learn a bit about whiskey and have a good tasting Definitely Avoid If You want to get up close with the distillation process Wild Turkey Versailles Rd Lawrenceburg KY Highlight View of the Kentucky River Lowlight None Tour A little under an hour This was one of my least favorite A bus drives you to the different locations and there wasn t as much to see at each stop Not much walking but a lot of steps Tasting I wasn t a huge fan but that s probably because I m not a big fan of Wild Turkey We tried Russel Single Barrel Rare Breed Barrel Proof Russel s Year Rye and American Honey Value Decent value for if you re a fan of Wild Turkey Whiskey Ambiance The distillery tour felt sterile and corporate The visitor center is relaxed Visitor Center Gift Shop The visitor center and gift shop have a great view of the Kentucky River I stood by the fence for a while after my tour and thought about all the great whiskeys that I had tasted throughout the day Freebies A large Wild Turkey glass Definitely Go If You really want a Wild Turkey tasting and glass Definitely Avoid If You have other distillery tours that you re doing and don t care much about the tasting Buffalo Trace Great Buffalo Trace Frankfort KY Highlight Freddie our tour guide Lowlight None Tour Trace Tour A little under an hour and a half For the sake of our schedule we did the most basic Trace Tour We also didn t need the whole behind the scenes deal since we were seeing so many other distilleries Nevertheless we got some unique information that we didn t hear on any other tour And our tour guide Freddie was by far the highlight A decent amount of walking but no steps on this tour until the end where there s an elevator Tasting Like Barton s who is also owned by Sazerac this wasn t the most extensive tasting but it was free Buffalo Trace might be my favorite bottom shelf whiskey Eagle Rare and the chocolate liquor were both good too Value Free Excellent value I d go again for one of the other tours for sure Ambiance This was in the top three for me alongside Maker s Mark and Woodford Reserve I liked getting to walk around before our tour started The buildings have a nice old yet well maintained feel to them Visitor Center Gift Shop Essentially just a large gift shop They had some selections here that I didn t see anywhere else though Freebies Tour and tasting Definitely Go If You want a free tour and decent tasting along with a walk around an appealing distillery Definitely Avoid If You really care about the tasting Woodford Reserve McCracken Pike Versailles KY Highlight Unique architecture Lowlight You can only walk around the actual distillery on the tour I would have loved more time for pictures afterwards Tour Distillery Tour Tour took an hour and fifteen minutes Even if you re seeing multiple distilleries I d recommend Woodford Reserve for its uniqueness The stonework is impressive and there s no other distillery like it The wooden fermentation cylinders are rustic and we got to try some of the mash from one Finally the pot stills are pieces of art in themselves They were the only ones I saw throughout the whole drive It made me want to make plans for an Ireland Scotland trip though I hear the Irish distilleries aren t much to see There was some walking and stairs though an elevator was provided Tasting This was one of the worst values especially with the price tag While I love Distiller s Select and Double Oaked I expected more for what I paid compared to other tours and tastings I hear good things about their new rye whiskey and would have loved to sample it Value Mediocre I m glad I took the tour but with the limited tasting and cost I doubt I would go back again Ambiance Beautiful Even the drive up to the distillery is appealing They re going for the la ti da market and they succeed Visitor Center Gift Shop This is the fancy gift shop If you re looking for a whiskey bow tie or overpriced more than others glass this is the place to get it Freebies None Definitely Go If You want to see something unique Definitely Avoid If You want value and don t care about uniqueness Four Roses Bonds Mill Rd Lawrenceburg KY Highlight None Lowlight None Tour I only did the tasting at Four Roses We were short on time and the tour was limited by construction so I figured this was the one to skip Tasting Decent tasting I got to try their Yellow Label Small Batch and Single Barrel I enjoyed learning about their ingredients and recipe process Value Good value for a tasting and a glass Ambiance Relaxed smaller than some of the others Visitor Center Gift Shop Pretty standard There were a few limited bottlings that were only available there Freebies Four Roses glass Definitely Go If If you like Four Roses and or just want a quick affordable tasting Definitely Avoid If You want an in depth tour George Dickel Cascade Hollow Rd Tullahoma TN Highlight Scenery and seeing their version of the Lincoln County process Lowlight None Tour Basic tour seeing the inner workings of their fairly small distillery Decent amount of walking and stairs Tasting Pretty good for I got their White and Barrel Select The set up was great too I wished I didn t have to leave Value Above average Good tour and tasting for Ambiance I felt like I was visiting my family out in the country The atmosphere was laid back and welcoming Visitor Center Gift Shop The usual plus a year bottle that s apparently only available in some places Freebies None Definitely Go If You want to see a full distillery tour with a tasting and don t want the Jack Daniels crowds Definitely Avoid If You would have to drive far out of your way and aren t a big fan of George Dickel Jack Daniels Lynchburg Hwy Lynchburg TN Highlight Tasting and a thorough tour Lowlight None Tour Angel s Share Distillery Tour Thorough and interactive We learned about the Lincoln County Process saw some Jack Daniels history and saw the ins and outs of the distilling process Walking and stairs included Tasting I did one of the more expensive tours tastings offered and it was worth it We tried Gold Sinatra Single Barrel Select Single Barrel Rye and Single Barrel Barrel Proof Value Pricey but worth it If you re going to splurge this is one place to do it Ambiance I ve seen it described as Disney World for whiskey fans I d agree and disagree It wasn t in that it actually didn t feel too overdone to me I was expecting over the top when I hear that description It was in the sense that it was clearly a tourist hot spot and everything seemed very professional and well done Visitor Center Gift Shop The visitor center has a walk through of whiskey and Jack Daniels history The gift center is somewhat odd You can buy a variety of whiskeys on site but any other trinket type items are in various stores a short walk away in Lynchburg Freebies None Definitely Go If You love Jack Daniels or you re in the area and want to see what the big deal is Definitely Avoid If You don t like crowds Prichard s Kelso Smithland Rd Kelso TN Highlight None Lowlight None Tour Short walk through the garage where Prichard s equipment is located Tasting Free and there are a lot of options most of which are rum that you get to pick four of Value You can t beat free but there isn t too much to see Ambiance Start up Visitor Center Gift Shop It s all in one at the Kelso location The facility is an old school house The tasting and some items for sale are located inside the main room when you walk in Freebies None Definitely Go If You re interested in seeing a distillery that s in the process of being created from the ground up Definitely Avoid If You re short on time and want to see a well known spot My

From party drinking to Sipping Whiskey,Just joined this Sub after a surprisingly life changing experience When I was in college I drank liquor for the same reason I drank anything else to get drunk With that reasoning in mind I never bothered to buy any worthwhile liquor I drank until I couldn t taste the terrible things I was consuming and years later I still have a bad taste in my mouth Because of negative experiences I became a beer drinker almost exclusively and vowed that hard liquor was just not a taste I could acquire again Until Today A friend of mine recently accepted a job offer that effectively moves her and her husband across the country and moves them very quickly She has a week before she starts the job she accepted Friday As such we decided we needed to have at least one good dinner together and spend some time helping them prepare for the move While we sat in their living room this afternoon they asked if as a favor we would take their stock of liquor as they didn t want to risk any bottles breaking during the drive I accepted a box of twelve bottles ranging from Grand Marnier eh to bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon Mixed in this case of alcohol was a bottle of Buffalo Trace After saying goodbye for the evening I came home and decided it was time to try sipping Whiskey again I poured fingers with one ice cube and slurped my first taste straight to the back of my mouth and shivered with the familiar burn After I sat at my PC to partake in my nightly routine of reading the daily news I stopped to ponder how I was going to consume this drink without wasting it In the middle of reading an article about a local tragedy I reached over to my glass and sipped a bit of Buffalo Trace onto the middle of my tongue I began to panic as my memory of whiskey on my tongue was filled with the likes of Lord Calvert and Jim Beam But before I could correct my mistake the damage was done I swallowed the bit of whiskey but the burn was overpowered by the phenomenal flavor that was left behind I closed my browser and turned to stare at my glass hoping that the results of my last taste weren t a freak accident I proceeded to take small taste after small taste Sometimes letting the amber liquid slide from the front to the back of my mouth and then down and sometimes keeping the whiskey on my tongue and breathing times just to find the different subtleties in each mouthful My glass now sits empty and my heart is breaking because I know that the road that my friend has started me down is one that is filled with fickle taste buds and an empty wallet But really my heart is breaking because I want another glass and I know this bottle won t last forever ,1,From party drinking to Sipping Whiskey Just joined this Sub after a surprisingly life

 Trailer Park boys Liqourmens ol Dirty Canadian Whiskey,I figured I d do a review of this because it s only available in certain areas of Canada This is a Whiskey endorsed by the trailer park boys a famous comedic trio with a show that spans seasons so far Purchasing this Whiskey I didn t have high hopes because of the name Luckily as I was soon found out you never judge a bottle by its labeling From the first sip I was head over heels in LOVE with this Whiskey Much better than Canadian Club yet in the same price range The flavor profile and nose is almost identical to Crown Royal For me I cannot tell much difference except that it s a bit of a sassy liquor It is not a bottom shelf whiskey certainly not a top shelf so to me it sits somewhere comforatably in the middle For the price it comes with essentially the same as Canadian Club in price range if you re buying in that price range this Whiskey is the way to go if you really want to treat yourself Goes great with an episode of Trailer Park Boys as well Let me know if you have any questions about it i really enjoyed it Edit I forgot to mention the flavor really comes through with the finish more so than when it first enters your mouth parts ,1, Trailer Park boys Liqourmens ol Dirty Canadian Whiskey I figured I d do a review of this because it s only available in certain areas of Canada This is a Whiskey endorsed by the trailer park boys a famous comedic trio with a show that spans seasons so far Purchasing this Whiskey I didn t have high hopes because of the name Luckily as I was soon found out you never judge a bottle by its labeling From the first sip I was head over heels in LOVE with this Whiskey Much better than Canadian Club yet in the same price range The flavor profile and nose is almost identical to Crown Royal For me I cannot tell much difference except that it s a bit of a sassy liquor It is not a bottom shelf whiskey certainly not a top shelf so to me it sits somewhere comforatably in the middle For the price it comes with essentially the same as Canadian Club in price range if you re buying in that price range this Whiskey is the way to go if you really want to treat yourself Goes great with an episode of Trailer Park Boys as well Let me know if you have any questions about it i really enjoyed it Edit I forgot to mention the flavor really comes through with the finish more so than when it first enters your mouth parts

I went to Whiskey Rocks NW last night it kinda sucked,The main reason why it sucked was that they were using plastic tasting cups and they stank really bad like plastic chemical type smell I went into the bathroom and washed mine three times to try to get rid of the smell it helped but it was still bad A contributing factor to the suckage was how crowded it was but that s a minor detail next to the stinky cup fiasco Other than those two details it was an awesome event I wish they hadn t dropped the ball on such an important detail Standard tickets were included tastings and they said it included a tasting glass but all I got was a stinky plastic cup The pours were maybe oz very small but it was actually kinda nice I got to try about different whiskeys and my sense of taste and smell held up pretty well because of the low consumption What was really cool about the tasting system was that everything cost one tasting Macallan Rare Cask and Pappy Van Winkle yr cost the same as Jack Daniels Honey and Evan Williams If I were to do it all over again which I would only do if they solve the stinky tasting cup issue I would spend on the VIP tickets which get you in an hour early and get you I think a total of tastings They had a surprising amount of high end bottles but pretty much only had one of each so once they ran out they were gone I was still surprised how long most of them lasted though The event was in Seattle WA and they were also selling some bottles for significantly lower prices than we usually get here which was cool I got bottles of Balvenie yr Buffalo Trace and Templeton Rye yr for a total of would have been after tax at my local Total Wine Here s the list of bottles that were available to taste good luck reading that And here s my very poorly done notes on what I tried The plastic tasting glasses stunk so I didn t feel very confident in my observations Macallan Fine Oak yr I could barely taste this all I could smell was the plastic from my cup The flavor was ok Teeling Whiskey Irish Single Malt Not a big fan some off flavors in my opinion Glen Moray Single Malt Port Cask Not bad wasn t blown away though Balvenie yr Doublewood I liked the doublewood very solid well rounded whiskey Balvenie yr Caribbean Cask I also liked the Caribbean Cask it was more popular than the doublewood it was a little sweeter and smoother I could go either way depending on my mood Highland Park yr The peat was very prominent definitely not anything massively different from the it was pretty good I wish I had a little more time with this one and a better glass Macallan Rare Cask Was very good and very Macallan wish my tasting cup didn t stink so I could have experienced more subtlety Blanton s I really liked Blanton s I d put it near the top of bourbons that I ve tried Would buy a bottle for sure Glenfarclas yr Wow this one hits you in the face with fruit Also it s good Would buy Pappy Van Winkle yr I didn t strongly dislike it but I d put it in the bottom half of the bottles that I tried that night Not a big fan Jack Daniels Single Barrel Bleh I wasn t feeling this one Tasted like Jack Daniels bottled at higher ABV not Jack Daniels we picked the most special casks and then bottled them for you Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Haha it tasted like oak shocker I remember thinking that it was a stronger flavor than I was expecting I didn t like it as much as I thought I would but I didn t dislike it Would like to try again Bruichladdich Port Charlotte Barley Wow I really liked this one peaty but in the best way I don t know what else to say would definitely buy Bruichladdich Octomore Also very good I think I liked the Islay Barley a little better but not only is the peat very strong it s also incredibly good and interesting Would

r whiskey s Intro to Whiskey, Intro to Whiskey Don t know much about whiskey but want to find out if whiskey is right for you Here s a comprehensive guide for you This guide covers two main topics How should I enjoy my whiskey and Which whiskey should I drink How should I enjoy my whiskey Many get confused about how to drink whiskey What s the optimal way to enjoy a glass of whiskey Is adding ice ok What type of glassware should I use and so on The good news is that there s no universal agreement on the best way to enjoy a glass You ve got lots of room to explore and find out what works best for you As long as you re enjoying your whiskey you re doing it right Here are a few different popular approaches to drinking whiskey along with their upsides and downsides nbsp Whiskey Based Cocktails Suggested Glassware A Cocktail Glass Suggested Cocktails Manhattan Old Fashioned Mix with Ginger Ale Upsides Very approachable and easy to drink Especially for those not accustomed to drinking full proof spirits Mix and match Experiment and see which spirits pair best with different mixers Downsides Masks the flavor of the whiskey so you can only appreciate a portion of what the spirit offers Sort of defeats the purpose if you re interested in experiencing the full spectrum of what whiskey can offer Some whiskies are made for mixing shooting while others are made for drinking on their own As a result many whiskies don t hold up well in cocktails You would experience fewer whiskies if you only stuck to cocktails nbsp Adding Ice Suggested Glassware A Rocks Glass with a heavy base Upsides Chilled whiskey has less burn More refreshing Some feel that introducing water can open up a glass and bring out hidden flavors More casual Rocks glasses feel good in your hand Downsides Chilling will dull some flavors and aromas this may be a good thing with some cheap whiskies though Fairly difficult to control how much water ends up in your glass so you sometimes end up with whiskey flavored ice water towards the end of your glass Pressures you to drink more quickly so you don t end up with whiskey flavored water Limits your glassware Ice does not work well in certain types of whiskey glasses e g Glencairns nbsp Adding a Splash of Water Suggested Glassware A tulip shaped glass like a Glencairn or Copita Upsides Reduces the burning sensation Some feel that introducing water can open up a glass and bring out hidden flavors Keeps the spirit at a more ideal temperature for nosing and tasting room temperature Allows you to control exactly how much water you add and get the profile you prefer Downsides Water could bring out less desirable flavors and aromas Diluting whiskey sometimes just makes it taste duller and weaker Water simply changes the flavor and doesn t always make it better nbsp Neat Undiluted Suggested Glassware A tulip shaped glass like a Glencairn or Copita Upsides Highest concentration of flavor and aroma available which means fuller flavors and longer finishes Presumably the distiller chose a specific proof because s he feels that specific alcohol level brings out its best qualities With undiluted whiskey you re experiencing more of the distiller s craft talent and intent Downsides The alcohol burn can overwhelm some drinkers and interfere with enjoyment nbsp Personally after a bunch of experimentation I found I prefer my whiskey neat in a glencairn glass I feel the glencairn glass enhances the nose quite a bit and is easy to handle Over time I ve gotten used to the burn so I don t usually feel a need to add water or ice Also I have never felt that adding water changed the whiskey enough for me to care However this is just one way to drink whiskey Experiment and find what works best for you Your preferences might change over time For me I got accustomed to the burning sensation so I gradually eased off the water Eventually I found myself drinking nearly everything neat Which whiskey should I drink There are a wide range of whiskies from all over the world which encompass a wide range of styles It s up to you to determine which style works best for you If you re just starting out I d recommend sticking with bottles in the proof range There are two main categories of whiskies Bourbon and Malt Whiskey Here s how they break down nbsp Bourbon Bourbon is made in America in new oak barrels It s primarily made from corn with some other flavoring grains like rye or wheat Some common flavor and aroma descriptors are vanilla caramel oak cinnamon and brown sugar As you may notice they tend to taste sweeter and spicier Proof can make a big difference in this category which is why a few recommendations clock in at or near proof Bourbons also tend to offer a better value in the lower price ranges so if you re especially sensitive to price I d recommend that you focus on bourbon Here s what s worth checking out Name Price range Notes Evan Williams Black Label Lots of brown sugar Simple but pleasant Old Grandad Bottled in Bond A bit spicier with a full sweet flavor Rittenhouse Rye Not technically a bourbon but related Spicier and a touch less sweet Wild Turkey Cherry and vanilla with a toasty oak backbone Evan Williams Single Barrel A prototypical and well rounded bourbon Maker s Mark Wheat is used as a flavoring grain which gives it a softer and sweeter profile Buffalo Trace Classic bourbon profile with big vanilla sweetness and oak Elijah Craig Small Batch Four Roses Single Barrel A spicier more intense bourbon from a beloved distiller High West Rendezvous Rye Blanton s Single Barrel Smooth flavor with a long finish prominent orange flavor and comes in a fancy bottle too nbsp Malt Whiskey Malt whiskey is a pretty broad category that encompasses some heavy hitters Namely Scotch Irish and Japanese whiskies They re all related because they use similar ingredients and production processes Their distillation centers around malted barley In nearly all cases the spirit is aged in used casks Malt whiskies tend to age longer than their Bourbon counterparts Most are also imported which means they tend to cost a bit more in the US Generally speaking I have a tough time finding a malt whiskey that excites me for under a bottle Malt whiskies can exhibit a wide range of characteristics ranging from smokey and earthy to light and fruity Sample as much as possible by buying minis splitting bottles with friends or going to a bar with a good selection to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy Here are some to try Light Fruity Name Price Range Type Speyburn Speyside Scotch Teeling

find that whiskies they once thought tasted smooth start coming across as flat and weak I ve tried to limit my suggestions here to whiskies that bridge the gap between interesting flavor and drinkability However I can t predict your comfort level with spirits so I can t guarantee that you ll have an easy time drinking them all If you have trouble tolerating the burn then feel free to add water or mixers to your glass or stick to easy drinking proof pours like Evan Williams Gentleman Jack Johnnie Walker or Teeling Small Batch until you re more acclimated to drinking whiskey I hope that

An Intro to Peated Whisk e y,Peat seems to confuse and intimidate many so here s a quick intro to demystify one of the most contentious aspects of whiskey What is peat Peat is partially decayed plant matter found in boggy terrain Throughout history people have dug it out of the ground dried it then burned it as fuel How does peat relate to whisk e y A key component of Scotch whisky production involves germinating barley grains Heat plays a vital part in this process Peat was once used as a fuel source by some distillers to dry out their grains While the grains were being heated by the burning peat some of the characteristics of its smoke leeched into the grain which then got carried through the distillation aging processes and into the final product Nowadays producers use more modern fuel sources to heat their barley but a few go out of their way to expose their barley to peat smoke to create a distinctive flavor profile Which whiskies are peated The vast majority of whiskies mdash including Scotch whiskies mdash are not peated at all Bourbons and Ryes are never peated or smoked Irish whiskies are almost exclusively unpeated In fact the majority of Scotches are unpeated as well If I were to walk into a liquor store and randomly choose a bottle of whiskey I d almost certainly choose a bottle without peat By and large when we talk about peated whiskies we re talking about a small subset of Scotches The most prominent and well known peated whiskies come from the Islay region of Scotland Distillers like Laphroaig Ardbeg and Lagavulin pride themselves on offering briny smoky and intensely flavored scotches However a fair amount of delicious peated whiskies are made outside of Islay and can offer different types of peated whisky experiences What does peat smell and taste like Firstly not all peat tastes the same Some peated whiskies can have an intense smoky flavor Others can have more subtle earthy and vegetal qualities woven into the background Other descriptions can include heather mushroom rubber band aid brine leather and sea moss Sounds kinda weird huh It is I ll be the first to admit that my own tasting notes make some peated scotches seem unpalatable yet I enjoy them immensely Why I like peated whiskies Some love peat at the outset most ease into peat over time and some never develop a taste for it at all All are perfectly reasonable and acceptable responses However don t shut yourself off from considering any peated whisky simply because it seems weird and unapproachable I didn t love my first heavily peated dram but over time I came to appreciate its unique and delicious properties Here s why I enjoy peat now Peat adds layers of flavor and aroma Sweet scotches are great but offer a somewhat narrow band of fruit centric flavors Peat often adds savory layers of earthiness and smokiness that draw me back for another sip and help me appreciate the complexities and nuances in my glass Peat can have a deep visceral quality Peated scotch is one of the few beverages that can transport my thoughts to another place and time When I drink Lagavulin I feel as if I m sitting in a leather chair near a fire in a stone cottage near the sea Very few other foods and beverages have such a strong influence on my thoughts and feelings Peat is unique and distinctive I sometimes get a little burned out on sweet beverages especially during chilly and wet weather Peated whiskies offer an unparalleled savory and complex alternative for those times when you re not in the mood for a fruit and sugar bomb Where to Get Started Lightly Moderately Peated Benromach A rare peated speyside Mildly sweet sherried scotch balanced out by a touch of smoky peat and woodiness Highland Park or This scotch has a little of everything including a nice earthy vegetal background which leads to a complex and very balanced dram Springbank Funky in a good way Its prominent creamy vanilla is balanced out by rich peat Johnnie Walker Black smooth and easy drinking with a wisp of peat Johnnie Walker Green Has a bit of everything including subtle peat in the background Talisker Peppery and salty with a backbone of peat An appropriate gateway to the more aggressive Islay scotches Heavily Peated Lagavulin Leather smoke and iodine Beginner friendly A good place to start with heavily peated Islay style Laphroaig Beach bonfire Ardbeg Black tar smoke brine Delicious I hope that was a helpful intro and helped you feel more comfortable with peat Feel free to ask questions below or correct any mistakes I may have made

Captain Don s Whisky Review,So first of all this is a strange and mysterious whisky unlike any I ve ever tried and if you can find it I m not sure it s available in the states you should definitely try it So Captain Don s whisky is made in a small distillery here on the island of Bonaire Bonaire is a small island off the coast of venezuela one of the ABC islands in the netherlands antilles Their only two industries are sea salt and tourism centered around their status as some of the best scuba diving in the world Approximately people live on the island which is only about kilometers long at the longest points Anyway the whisky is made from corn rye and sorghum which gives it an oddly sweet taste balanced by the rye s spice It is matured in new oak casks with tobacco leaves added which also balanes the sweetness with a smoky lingering aftertaste Id give it a out of its delicious and novel enough that any shortcomings are overshadowed by the sheer uniqueness of the flavor profile It s what the Balvenie Carribbean Cask wishes it was Im excited to try this again with my pipe as well Nose A bit young this is not an old whisky Id estimate ish years Elements of sweet oak and frankly an indescribable maybe Molasses sort of thing going on Palate Smooth at only proof it doesnt have much bite and none of the oilyness im used to with some scotches It also somehow avoids all of the harshness in the nose becoming a delicious summer whiskey while the raw tobacco flavoring gives it enough body to satisfy on a chilly winter day Finish Pure tobacco similar to a pipe None of the sourness of a cigar though and with just enough lingering sweetness ,1,Captain Don s Whisky Review So first of all this is a strange and mysterious whisky unlike any I ve ever tried and if you can find it I m not sure it s available in the states you should definitely try it So Captain Don s whisky is made in a small distillery here on the island of Bonaire Bonaire is a small island off the coast of venezuela one of the ABC islands in the netherlands antilles Their only two industries are sea salt and tourism centered around their status as some of the best scuba diving in the world Approximately people live on the island which is only about kilometers long at the longest points Anyway the whisky is made from corn rye and sorghum which gives it an oddly sweet taste balanced by the rye s spice It is matured in new oak casks with tobacco leaves added which also balanes the sweetness with a smoky lingering aftertaste Id give it a out of its delicious and novel enough that any shortcomings are overshadowed by the sheer uniqueness of the flavor profile It s what the Balvenie Carribbean Cask wishes it was Im excited to try this again with my pipe as well Nose A bit young this is not an old whisky Id estimate ish years Elements of sweet oak and frankly an indescribable maybe Molasses sort of thing going on Palate Smooth at only proof it doesnt have much bite and none of the oilyness im used to with some scotches It also somehow avoids all of the harshness in the nose becoming a delicious summer whiskey while the raw tobacco flavoring gives it enough body to satisfy on a chilly winter day Finish Pure tobacco similar to a pipe None of the sourness of a cigar though and with just enough lingering sweetness

I tried my New Favorite Whiskey Last Night,So I ve only been dabbling for a year and a half or so figuring out what tastes I like and what I never want to taste again At the beginning of my adventuring I tried a bottle of Bulleit Rye and quickly fell in love It was on sale though so I don t often have it in my collection and I would also go through it much too quickly because I love it My grandma and I always used to trade our favorite alcohols and shortly before she passed earlier this year she bought me a bottle of Wild Turkey Rye that I just can t bring myself to finish I also found that I really really like this one but it s not quite as drinkable I was out last night because I got out of work early and I always sample the whiskey at one of my local bars They have a pretty large selection so I figured I would go in and try a few new ones once or twice a month Last night I went for comfort with some Bulleit and then tried a dram of the Whistle Pig Straight Rye At first sip the higher proof was slightly over powering of the flavor of the drink I put just a few drops of water in and I have to say this is my new favorite whiskey I checked it out and the bill is apparently rye The mouth feel was just thick enough that I didn t feel like I was drinking water but I wasn t drinking anything syrupy The taste was full a little spicy but still sweet ish Definitely a little vanilla and maybe some sweet nuttiness I really should ve taken better notes last night rather than try to remember it today Anyway I really really enjoyed it and although it s a bit out of my price range at the moment I highly recommend this to anyone especially if you enjoy rye ,1,I tried my New Favorite Whiskey Last Night So I ve only been dabbling for a year and a half or so figuring out what tastes I like and what I never want to taste again At the beginning of my adventuring I tried a bottle of Bulleit Rye and quickly fell in love It was on sale though so I don t often have it in my collection and I would also go through it much too quickly because I love it My grandma and I always used to trade our favorite alcohols and shortly before she passed earlier this year she bought me a bottle of Wild Turkey Rye that I just can t bring myself to finish I also found that I really really like this one but it s not quite as drinkable I was out last night because I got out of work early and I always sample the whiskey at one of my local bars They have a pretty large selection so I figured I would go in and try a few new ones once or twice a month Last night I went for comfort with some Bulleit and then tried a dram of the Whistle Pig Straight Rye At first sip the higher proof was slightly over powering of the flavor of the drink I put just a few drops of water in and I have to say this is my new favorite whiskey I checked it out and the bill is apparently rye The mouth feel was just thick enough that I didn t feel like I was drinking water but I wasn t drinking anything syrupy The taste was full a little spicy but still sweet ish Definitely a little vanilla and maybe some sweet nuttiness I really should ve taken better notes last night rather than try to remember it today Anyway I really really enjoyed it and although it s a bit out of my price range at the moment I highly recommend this to anyone especially if you enjoy rye

starts with a sharp burn in the mouth and ends with a peppery burn when swallowed Mild spice flavour Dislike it would not even date swipe left on Tinder Glenlivet Founder s Reserve modded with one of those scorched oak sticks for about months The colour difference is striking when compared with the unmodded version The whiskey here is a striking orange The nose is rich and woodsy lots of oak vanilla and perhaps a tiny hint of smoke Flavour wise you still have spice but now you get a large dose of vanilla and honey on the tongue Smooth burn when swallowing moderately long finish Much improved and surprisingly smooth to drink excellent dating prospect Would recommend trying this proces with whiskey you can t stand leave for a couple of months and see what happens No loss right Mackmyra Iskristall Bright golden colour with a sweet fruity smell mixing with the wood aroma Liquorice flavour unexpectedly delightful rather sweet and ever so slightly glue y Moderate to long finish very smooth burn A plus plus recommended except when you dislike liquorice Quirky Swede would definitely last in a long term relationship Suntory Yamazaki Golden orange in tone nose is fairly strong with sweet glue and wood aromas Tastes less sweet than you would expect a lot of oak there too Fairly strong burn when swallowing moderate finish and you are left with some more oak and a little black

a lovely surprise Husband but soon to be ex since my bottle is almost empty Nikka Coffey Malt Golden colour with a surprisingly fresh smell It has got wood but has a citrusy and sharp smell Flavour is mostly caramel I didn t get any citrus on my palate but rather sharp Short to moderate finish not very smooth The nose on this whiskey is incredibly interesting flavour is good Thinking about buying this myself Husband material but it will not be a long marriage Aberlour A Bunadh batch A deep red orange in colour it s quite sharp on the nose alcohol Otherwise some cinnamon and sweet dried fruits

And American White Oak Amber colour pepper with some serious glue and wood in the nose Peppery palate with some barley flavour Expected it to be sweeter or with more vanilla was not very sweet at all Want to try this one again needs a second impression Needs a second first date Lagavulin Golden orange in colour smells of smoke and iodine and the man of my dreams Lots of flavour lots of woud and a fair amount of iodine The finish is moderate quite smooth still with more iodine Would absolutely date this one not sure about marriage Lagavulin The Distiller s Edition Golden orange with a mildly

Review of the Highspire Whiskey Made with Pure Rye,If you are like me you love a good rye and recent additions to the market have not failed to impress From the proof Pikesville from Heaven Hill to the various offerings from Smooth Ambler there are numerous products on the market to satisfy your taste and price point In order to fulfill demand for rye we are now seeing a multitude of young whiskeys on the market Initially I was scared to drop good money on the Willet year product but I am sure glad I did I have to say the mellowness and flavor coming out of that bottle is truly impressive The Willet year rye has not disappointed either In the spirit of appreciation for these under aged products we submit this review of Highspire month Rye Coming out of Kentucky Artisan Distilleries in Crestwood KY Highspire comes in at proof after being finished in wine barrels from Austin Hope Winery in California for months The attractive bottle comes sealed with blue wax I must say that once I poured myself a shot I certainly did not expect as must color to have been extracted from the barrel in the brief time it spent while at rest It had a nice brown hue Not nearly as red hued as your typical sipper but still appealing Similar to its more aged brethren this rye whiskey was extremely floral but with a sharper nose often refined by years of aging The flavor was immediate Reminiscent of a flavor forward reposado tequila this whiskey covered the palate with floral and red berry notes Due to its youth the sharp flavor did not evolve or develop throughout the tasting It is not overly complex but it definitely suggests that this juice will soon develop into something more refined and flavorful down the line I rarely mix my whiskey but I wanted to see how this rye would interact in a cocktail I muddled my first peach of the season some mint lime and a bit of sorghum in a mug poured some Highspire and let it mingle for a few minutes I shook the mix with ice and strained into a new iced highball and topped with a splash of soda It turned out to be a pretty good cocktail The complexity of the sorghum countered the youth of the rye The juicy peach complemented the fruit forward notes and the herbal flavor of the mint softened the sharpness of the spirit At this level of aging Highspire is better served within a cocktail to complement its flavor profile There certainly are some things to be excited about if this label continues to provide ryes with a bit more age Coming in at a price point of approximately they are churning out a decent product now

Whiskey FAQ s ,I m starting the guide figured we ll start here If I m missing anything or you d like to put the answers into a more eloquent form please do so below nbsp r Whiskey FAQs Q Whiskey or Whisky A Completely interchangable In general Scotland and Canada use whisky America and Ireland use whiskey but there are some that go against the grain nbsp Q I have an old bottle of Canadian whisky is it worth anything A of the time this is a big no Unless you have something from before the s its probably worth There are exceptions but Seagrams Crown Royal and Canadian Club are not these exceptions Crown Royal XR red box waterloo is actually worth a bit of dough nbsp Q I enjoy the lighter flavors and a overall smooth whiskey Make a recommendation A Generally Canadian whisky Irish whiskey Highland Scotch Japanese whiskey and a few others are on the softer side of things There are exceptions in every category so make sure to read some reviews beforehand There are also lighter bourbons like Weller and Blantons if you want to go that route nbsp Q What kind of glassware should I use A The glencairn is the most popular glass among the whiskey crowd at the moment its large bulbous bottom allows the spirit to breathe and concentrates these aromas near the smaller opening The NEAT glass copitas and wine glasses are good as well but by no means necessary Feel free to sip out of a rocks glass or even a dixie cup if you so desire If you re looking to analyze scent the NEAT glass is the frontrunner in this category That is exactly what its been designed for and it does its job very well Glencairns would be my next choice then a copita The trouble with the NEAT glass is that its awkward to drink from giving the glencairn the top spot overall for dissecting the flavors in your whiskey nbsp Q Ice Water or neat A Personal preference If its too much for your palate to handle I d certainly recommend adding a few drops of filtered water Repeat until you can drink it comfortably add a mixer such as ginger ale or create various cocktails like the Old Fashioned As for ice it will dull your palate but you shouldn t feel the need to dissect your drink with every glass It can also dull the heat from higher proofs whiskies that have a heavy ethanol taste or generally make cheaper whiskey more enjoyable This hobby is about enjoying what you drink so add whatever you want Never listen to the purists Ginger ale is a great mixer to use with with whiskey It lets the spirit come through nicely while adding sweetness a little spice from the ginger and dilutes the drink nbsp Q What kind of cocktails mixed drinks should I try A I m going to keep this very simple Visit r cocktails or google for a bazillion others Bourbon Rye Old Fashioned Manhattan Whiskey Sour Sazerac Scotch malts Rob Roy Rusty Nail The Godfather nbsp Q Can I use mini barrels or staves at home to age whiskey A Not really The surface areas are too small and impart the flavors from the wood far too quickly You re likely to end up with a very oaky whiskey without the nuances you ll get from a longer aged whiskey Many people are using these to make aged cocktails or adding wine finishes to their spirit with some good results nbsp Q Does whiskey age in the bottle A No Unlike wine it will not get better with age Stored properly it will last alot longer then you will but improper storage may lead to your whiskey getting worse nbsp Q How should I store my whiskey A In a cool dark spot with the bottles upright Hard alcohol will eat your cork if left on its side If its been opened and you intend on leaving it sit for awhile you may want to consider using an inert gas to replace the oxygen in the bottle to avoid oxidation Any wine store will carry it ,1,Whiskey FAQ s  I m starting

Whisky Advocate s Winter Issue s Highest Rated Whiskies,,1,Whisky Advocate s Winter Issue s Highest Rated Whiskies 
How to make a good whiskey sour a drink I ve become somewhat obsessed with in recent years,I m sitting in my sister s New York apartment on the Upper West Side having a drink Her three friends are there drinking a bottle of wine The conversation dies for a moment and in a pretentious New York accent my sister s friend asks What are you drinking A whiskey sour I reply With an incredulous laugh she exclaims We used to drink those in high school Nah you didn t drink these in high school There s really two kinds of whiskey sours the mixed drink and the cocktail The mixed drink is garbage It features a store bought sour mix that contains artificial flavoring and corn syrup Aging women used to drink these in high school The cocktail version of the whiskey sour is possibly the most underrated drink in all mixology although it seems to be making a comeback with the resurgence of the cocktail genre It s a simple drink consisting of only three basic ingredients and water When mixed properly it tastes like fresh boozy creamy orange juice How to Make a Good Whiskey Sour The Whiskey Whiskey sours are made with all types of whiskey I go for bourbon and to me it s the clear best choice In terms of quality I ve made sours with everything from Evan Williams to Jim Beam to Maker s Mark to Angel s Envy If money is no option go for the good stuff Otherwise Evan Williams does just fine Scotch sours are a thing and to me not a good thing So be careful with pricier bourbons that have the characteristics of a scotch e g Four Roses Edit Not really sure what I m trying to describe here by characteristics of a scotch Maybe I m referring to a strong flavor that doesn t go well with a sour maybe it s oak The Sugar The standard is white sugar mixed with equal parts water to make simple syrup Simple syrup stays for days so make enough for a few days worth of drinks I usually mix a half cup of sugar and a half cup of water and heat it over a stove until the sugar dissolves Don t let it boil and stir it to help the sugar dissolve There s a little room to play around here Brown sugar makes a darker syrup and a darker drink with different notes There s a cocktail bar in New York that makes all of their drinks with agave Personally I keep coming back to the white stuff The Sour The standard is lemon juice lime juice or a combination of the two I used to make my sours exclusively with lemon juice until my local bartender revealed to me that she uses equal parts lemon and lime juice This intrigued me because her sour had a much more creamy orange flavor Since then I ve been using lime for every two lemons and I m enjoying the same results at home The freshness of the juice is critical to a quality sour Citrus juice will stay in your fridge for days but it will never taste as good as day I ll usually squeeze lemons and limes and keep it in the fridge for the night If I m drinking the next day I ll use the juice again After that I m opting for fresh juice Edit A commenter shared that some people have looked into this and there is evidence that lemon and lime juices reaches it s peak about hours after juicing Strain your juice too Pulp and lime seeds have no place in a whiskey sour The Water If your tap water sucks it s going to affect your syrup and your ice cubes Use bottled water or a brita filter Also be wary of your freezer Some freezers smell pretty bad and it affects the ice and ultimately your sour Clean your freezer and buy some baking soda The Recipe oz whiskey oz syrup oz lemon lime juice Put those in a shaker with a couple of ice cubes and shake well The point of shaking is not just to make your drink cold and mix the ingredients it s to water the drink down a bit Pour over ice in a properly sized glass A highball or rocks glass works just fine Bitters Sure go ahead Not needed in my opinion but Angostura bitters seems to be the standard Try mixing them in the shaker or floating a few drops on top Egg Whites Sure why not Egg whites add a little body to the drink and a layer of foam A half an egg white is enough for one drink Add the egg white in before adding ice and give it a dry shake shake without ice This helps the proteins in the egg form a nice foam Also pour the drink through a strainer or the foam will be excessively thick Enjoying a Sour The drink might be a little sweet or strong when you first pour it As the ice melts it will hit a peak and then slowly become watered down I enjoy all phases of the sour but I m a little more attentive when the drink is in the sweet spot Not happy with the sour Play with it until you are If you re too good for the drink move to Brooklyn and drink wine ,1,How to make a good whiskey sour a drink I ve become somewhat obsessed with in recent years I m sitting in my

Whiskey Tasting Party Reviews whiskeys ,This past Friday I invited some friends over to try some of the whiskeys I got as a birthday present Below is the review of each EG Reserve Crown Royal This is my personal oak aged whiskey I aged Liters of standard Crown Premium in an American white oak barrel for months The result contained strong notes of oak and caramel with a slight maple sweetness both on the nose and in the taste The nose also contained a slight smell of men s cologne The abundance of oak and caramel completely masked the alcohol burn but the alcohol effect was definitely present My guests and even my wife a self proclaimed hater of whiskey thought this whiskey was incredibly drinkable Bourbon Notes of caramel corn toffee and baked goods on the nose Very sweet and light Made me think of the state fair or something similar Tasted like sweet cornbread to me My guests thought this was an incredible bourbon and everyone agreed it would be perfect for bourbon based mixed drinks My wife liked the sweetness and caramel notes so she used this to make an Irish coffee style mixed drink Old St Pete Whiskey A local whiskey from Florida My sister lives in St Petersburg FL so she thought this would be a fun local addition to the tasting Strongly fruity on the nose I thought this whiskey had a strong floral taste I have to give it a few more tries to see if I can appreciate it but for now this one isn t for me A few of my guests had just one or two sips and turned down the rest My wife couldn t stand it Crown Royal Special Reserve This was used as a comparison for the previous three whiskeys Seeing as how this was a more standard whiskey it was easy for everyone to say X whiskey had more Y notes than Crown Reserve Not going to bore you all with notes Snake River Stampede This was brought by a friend attending the party He claimed it had too strong of an alcohol bite for his tastes having only had one glass himself and wanted to donate it to the tasting He wasn t wrong This whiskey has a pretty noticeable alcohol bite almost rivaling that of a vodka It has a little bit of a vanilla and oak taste to try and balance but it falls short of masking that bite to make this a smooth whiskey I ll drink it but wouldn t buy it My guests were not impressed other than the two that like to get drunk on the weekends and my wife nearly spat out her one sip Have any of you tried these whiskeys Thoughts What should I get next ,1,Whiskey Tasting Party Reviews whiskeys  This past Friday I invited some friends over to try some of the whiskeys I got as a birthday present Below is the review of each EG Reserve Crown Royal This is my personal oak aged whiskey I aged Liters of standard Crown Premium in an American white oak barrel for months The result contained strong notes of oak and caramel with a slight maple sweetness both on the nose and in the taste The nose also contained a slight smell of men s cologne The abundance of oak and caramel completely masked the alcohol burn but the alcohol effect was definitely present My guests and even my wife a self proclaimed hater of whiskey thought this whiskey was incredibly drinkable Bourbon Notes of caramel corn toffee and baked goods on the nose Very sweet and light Made me think of the state fair or something similar Tasted like sweet cornbread to me My guests thought this was an incredible bourbon and everyone agreed it would be perfect for bourbon based mixed drinks My wife liked the sweetness and caramel notes so she used this to make an Irish coffee style mixed drink Old St Pete Whiskey A local whiskey from Florida My sister lives in St Petersburg FL so she thought this would be a fun local addition to the tasting Strongly fruity on the nose I thought this whiskey had a strong floral taste I have to give it a few more tries to see if I can appreciate it but for now this one isn t for me A few of my guests had just one or two sips and turned down the rest My wife couldn t stand it Crown Royal Special Reserve This was used as a comparison for the previous three whiskeys Seeing as how this was a more standard whiskey it was easy for everyone to say X whiskey had more Y notes than Crown Reserve Not going to bore you all with notes Snake River Stampede This was brought by a friend attending the party He claimed it had too strong of an alcohol bite for his tastes having only had one glass himself and wanted to donate it to the tasting He wasn t wrong This whiskey has a pretty noticeable alcohol bite almost rivaling that of a vodka It has a little bit of a vanilla and oak taste to try and balance but it falls short of masking that bite to make this a smooth whiskey I ll drink it but wouldn t buy it My guests were not impressed other than the two that like to get drunk on the weekends and my wife nearly spat out her one sip Have any of you tried these whiskeys Thoughts What should I get next

What makes good whiskey ,I know a fair bit about cooking I know what is required for good food fresh ingredients and often long marinating or simmering time for meat I know good whiskey when I taste it But what I don t know is what is necessary for a good whiskey Surely the quality of the grain matters but what qualities make a good grain I ve heard many Scotch advertisements say they search for the best wood what makes for good wood I ve had several year whiskeys but still noticed quite a difference in quality So it s not simply time there s something more that is impacting quality But what is it I thought answering these questions would enable us all to appreciate the drink a bit more Thanks ,1,What makes good whiskey  I know a fair bit about cooking I know what is required for good food fresh ingredients and often long marinating or simmering time for meat I know good whiskey when I taste it But what I don t know is what is necessary for a good whiskey Surely the quality of the grain matters but what qualities make a good grain I ve heard many Scotch advertisements say they search for the best wood what makes for good wood I ve had several year whiskeys but still noticed quite a difference in quality So it s not simply time there s something more that is impacting quality But what is it I thought answering these questions would enable us all to appreciate the drink a bit more Thanks

Did a tour of Wigle Whiskey in Pittsburgh some thoughts ,Was a really neat tour to see the production from grain to bottle all in a pretty small location and there was a really cool story of the whiskey production in Western PA just after the American Revolution Here s a quick video of their story The tour started with a cocktail of your choice Ran through milling mashing fermenting distilling and aging then finished with sampling all of their main products neat The table had water with eye droppers as well as ice if you wanted to try them with ice and or water The product is sooooooo young They use very small casks gallons to try to speed up the flavoring of the whiskey and they also sell a lot of unaged whiskey no color to it just like you may have bought back during the early years of our country While I appreciated the farm to bottle sort of aspect of their process the whiskey itself was very rough I look forward to some of their aged offerings in the future One other thing that they make which I thought was their best stuff is a spiced honey spirit Almost like rum but rather than sugar cane or molasses they use some local honey and add spices in the aging process It was delicious Anyways if you re in the Pittsburgh area or just passing through it s definitely worth the stop to get a tour of the facility Was a lot of fun and very informative I d love to read a book on the whiskey rebellion if anyone has a recommendation ,1,Did a tour of Wigle Whiskey in Pittsburgh some thoughts  Was a really neat tour to see the production from grain to bottle all in a pretty small location and there was a really cool story of the whiskey production in Western PA just after the American Revolution Here s a quick video of their story The tour started with a cocktail of your choice Ran through milling mashing fermenting distilling and aging then finished with sampling all of their main products neat The table had water with eye droppers as well as ice if you wanted to try them with ice and or water The product is sooooooo young They use very small casks gallons to try to speed up the flavoring of the whiskey and they also sell a lot of unaged whiskey no color to it just like you may have bought back during the early years of our country While I appreciated the farm to bottle sort of aspect of their process the whiskey itself was very rough I look forward to some of their aged offerings in the future One other thing that they make which I thought was their best stuff is a spiced honey spirit Almost like rum but rather than sugar cane or molasses they use some local honey and add spices in the aging process It was delicious Anyways if you re in the Pittsburgh area or just passing through it s definitely worth the stop to get a tour of the facility Was a lot of fun and very informative I d love to read a book on the whiskey rebellion if anyone has a recommendation

Bourbon Trail trip recap reposted here for visibility ,Warning I am as much a foodie as a whisky fan so this post will cover both We landed in Nashville without too much hullabaloo and headed north We had intended to eat in Nashville but the crowd and the sheer volume of flashing blue lights made us want to get out of town So we headed out and ate at a small place for locals tourist hipster image here We were rather a site and got many confused looks so we finished and left We arrived at a seedy motel in Elizabethtown and stayed the night Mind you we left on Pacific Time and switched to Eastern Time so when we got up at it felt like It was a tired morning My partner in crime not pictured had lived in Virginia for years and had never been to a Waffle House Astounded I insisted we break our fast there On to the good stuff We drove out to Bardstown towards Makers Mark I recommend the drive endless farmland Though it was quite frozen when we drove past We arrived at Makers Mark and they made quite a big deal out of the ambassador program If you are not an ambassador I strongly recommend it even if Makers isn t a favorite Pics with description here From there we headed for Willet tired exhausted and determined We opted to eat after Willet for reasons of time Pics here Finally Heaven Hill Heaven Hill was cool as we finally got some food When we walked in we were tired and they offered us a free upgrade to their top tour to make us and the guide not need to walk around in the frigid outdoors Worth it The tour was pretty short but the bourbon was tasty Pics here The Whisky fun is over The rest is eats and sights Pics here From there we headed to Louisville where we stayed at the Seelbach If you have never been go Legend has it that was a Capone haunt when he was still in business Another legend states that Fitzgerald was inspired to write The Great Gatsby there The hotel also houses one of the top bars in the world which was closed for renovations when we were there many a poo poo face was had The hotel was built at a time before cars so most travelers probably weren t going to stray too far from the hotel As a result the Seelbach has multiple bars and restaurants There was a wedding and most of it was too busy for the likes of us So we went down to the Brown Hotel just down the street for dinner at the English Grill Fine dining here Wow There was a loud obnoxious group of the Louisville elite crowding up the main dining room They were drunk and had drunk volume We think they were there for some horse trading We detected some foreign accents and vague talk of horses Pretty interesting From there we had intended a pub crawl but only had the juice to get to Down One I loved the bourbon they had Pappy Van Winkle we also learned that the stuff we tried for almost free at Heaven Hill goes for upwards of shot Pappy was cool but I was bourboned out So we headed back to the hotel intent to hit up the bar in the basement It was closed for a private event when we left and closed for the night on return Oops We ended up at the bar of the Oak Room fine dining at the Seelbach According to one guys yelp review they kept a private poker room for Al Capone there With enough reservation you can eat and probably play poker there The bar had Van Winkle Family Rye That was worth writing home about By that time I was too drunk to remember taking any pics Next morning we had intended to go back to Whisky Row and have lunch but everything was closed due to some kind of bird The Superb Owl or some shit Anyway we ate at a microbrew place that was similar to what we have at home We headed for Nashville intent on seeing a plantation before leaving and ended up on the wrong onramp Into Indiana we went It was very odd to see the change in advertising North of the river every billboard seemed to be for a group intended to help you stop drinking or smoking South of the river seemed more normal We arrived way too late to see the plantation but ended up at an amazing BBQ joint and watched the majestic bird thing It was a pretty cool place The locals were coming in by the truck load to get to go orders to eat at home while watching the Owl thingy The staff was there completely decked out in Seahawks gear Their families were really the only people occupying the dining room other than us The food was amazing I don t know of any place that makes BBQ like that out here in California I think it has to be in your DNA We went home and were ultimately disappointed Band wagon post about passing when you should have run Luck shined on us the next morning We stumbled into Monell s A beautiful mansion turned into a restaurant Family style seating family style food I ate like a pig just like the complete stranger sitting next to me I strongly recommend the place Next stop was the airport where luck decided to show us the other side of the coin Our flight was originally routed through O Hare and had been cancelled So we ended up being bounced around ended up going through Denver and got home well into Monday Going to work Monday morning was painful and I have been trying to recover all week Hence the late post TL

 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection Whiskeys,I think we re the first up with reviews on these so I wanted to bring them to the r whiskey community George T Stagg Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey George T Stagg is the archetypal power whiskey and Buffalo Trace has again delivered another expression of George T Stagg in that style In many ways it s a little bit of a head fake before the knock out punch The entry is really good and we really like the integration between the strong flavors but the end of the midpalate and the finish are over oaked With so many other big oak releases out there it may be what people are coming to expect but it could have been handled with a little more finesse Then again Stagg is always more power than finesse A solid but imperfect release that will appease Stagg fans but fall short of winning a ton of awards points William Larue Weller Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey The opening and midpalate set the stage for William Larue Weller s crescendo and when it comes it s really spectacular The finish is of course dry defined greatly in part by the alcohol blast at the end of the midpalate and accompanied by toffee and sweet charred oak The William Larue Weller takes water extremely well a few drops intensifies the lushness of the whiskey Good whiskey has the ability to take you on a journey and this year s William Larue Weller does just that It s a more complete whiskey than this year s George T Stagg and ultimately a much better one points Thomas H Handy Sazerac Rye While Thomas H Handy isn t horrid it s not even close to the standard that Buffalo Trace has set for this brand For us this will be the benchmark whiskey in this collection for reviews Read a review that raves about this misfire and you know that the reviewer may be rating the label more than the whiskey in the bottle points Eagle Rare Year Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey This year s Eagle Rare release like many of the other entries in the Eagle Rare line proves that great whiskey doesn t have to be so difficult capture some nice flavors with balance integration a nice mouthfeel and a good finish and you ve got a recipe for success Eagle Rare continues its

Flavor muddled after only a week ,Hey Guys So I have possibly a weird one I got a bottle of Bulleit Rye last Thursday I had some on both Friday night and Saturday night while camping and then shelved it for the week When I opened it up for a glass last night its profile was completely changed Most notably it had lost its spice bite and developed a sweetness I didn t expect There was no large temperature change but it may have been jostled around in the car Now it is a given that any whisky will change change flavor after oxidizing or bruising but I have never had anything happen as quickly as a week Is it possible that I bruised the hell out of it while camping and this is what caused the flavor change so quickly My first thought was that I got a bad quark but that should have muddled the flavor before opening Any other ideas ,1,Flavor muddled after only a week  Hey Guys So I have possibly a weird one I got a bottle of Bulleit Rye last Thursday I had some on both Friday night and Saturday night while camping and then shelved it for the week When I opened it up for a glass last night its profile was completely changed Most notably it had lost its spice bite and developed a sweetness I didn t expect There was no large temperature change but it may have been jostled around in the car Now it is a given that any whisky will change change flavor after oxidizing or bruising but I have never had anything happen as quickly as a week Is it possible that I bruised the hell out of it while camping and this is what caused the flavor change so quickly My first thought was that I got a bad quark but that should have muddled the flavor before opening Any other ideas

Laphroaig a noob s review, Bought myself a bottle of year Laphroaig for the first time I ve been meaning to try it for quite a while but I ve always gone with something else instead perhaps because it gets quite mixed reviews Thought I d document my first thoughts here Quick smell The first thing that came to mind was damp earth Reminded me of playing in the garden as a child and pulling up a large stone or rock that hadn t been moved for a long time That rising aroma of wet soil as a woodlouse scurries past a wriggling worm Definitely some saltiness there too mixed with a whiff of damp vegetation which gives me a hint of seaweed But it s definitely a wet and rainy day on this beach There s a bit of orange there with a touch of spice Similar to the mince pies my nan used to make at Christmas I found it an extremely pleasant smell and very distinctive I m pretty sure that after this single smelling I d be able to identify Laphroaig any time Taste A lot of saltiness on the tongue an almost bitter woodiness There s a softer side to it as well I struggled for a while to explain it but I think its kind of creamy As I was tasting it a bit of it went down the wrong way and I found myself coughing at which point a nice taste of vanilla essence came through After taste This goes on for a long time I could sit here for an hour and still taste it in my mouth There s some orange peel creamy boiled sweets Again there s the saltiness which actually becomes stronger as I move my tongue along the roof of my mouth Some of the flavours taste like things that I probably shouldn t be drinking but can t quite put my finger on As I exhale there s some liquorice there and as I inhale there s that creaminess again Verdict This may be the first whiskey that I buy twice in a row I always buy something I ve never tried before Really enjoyed it It s strange because I can almost taste exactly what the bad reviews are talking about but I personally can t identify any of them as negative points Very refreshing I probably find the smell the most pleasurable part only slightly ahead of the taste though It really feels like you re taking in a massive breath of ocean air I won t attempt to give it a score because I don t feel qualified But if there are any of you that haven t given it a try I d strongly recommend it I ll look into other Islay whiskey s to try next ,1,Laphroaig a noob s review  Bought myself a bottle of year Laphroaig for the first time I ve been meaning to try it for quite a while but I ve always gone with something else instead perhaps because it gets quite mixed reviews Thought I d document my first thoughts here Quick smell The first thing that came to mind was damp earth Reminded me of playing in the garden as a child and pulling up a large stone or rock that hadn t been moved for a long time That rising aroma of wet soil as a woodlouse scurries past a wriggling worm Definitely some saltiness there too mixed with a whiff of damp vegetation which gives me a hint of seaweed But it s definitely a wet and rainy day on this beach There s a bit of orange there with a touch of spice Similar to the mince pies my nan used to make at Christmas I found it an extremely pleasant smell and very distinctive I m pretty sure that after this single smelling I d be able to identify Laphroaig any time Taste A lot of saltiness on the tongue an almost bitter woodiness There s a softer side to it as well I struggled for a while to explain it but I think its kind of creamy As I was tasting it a bit of it went down the wrong way and I found myself coughing at which point a nice taste of vanilla essence came through After taste This goes on for a long time I could sit here for an hour and still taste it in my mouth There s some orange peel creamy boiled sweets Again there s the saltiness which actually becomes stronger as I move my tongue along the roof of my mouth Some of the flavours taste like things that I probably shouldn t be drinking but can t quite put my finger on As I exhale there s some liquorice there and as I inhale there s that creaminess again Verdict This may be the first whiskey that I buy twice in a row I always buy something I ve never tried before Really enjoyed it It s strange because I can almost taste exactly what the bad reviews are talking about but I personally can t identify any of them as negative points Very refreshing I probably find the smell the most pleasurable part only slightly ahead of the taste though It really feels like you re taking in a massive breath of ocean air I won t attempt to give it a score because I don t feel qualified But if there are any of you that haven t given it a try I d strongly recommend it I ll look into other Islay whiskey s to try next
